"which have repeatedly been asserted to exist between the poet and his half-sister. And it is not a little striking that the action of Byron's other play, his celebrated *Cain*, should be laid in the primal family, {cont}"
"There is thus a direct contradiction of a soul having been bartered. This mistake on Schreber's part was probably not without its significance.―It is plausible, by the way, to connect the plot of *Manfred* with the incestuous relations {cont}"
"And here our thread breaks off short.²
² By way of substantiating the above assertion I will quote a passage from the last scene of the play, in which Manfred says to the demon who has come to fetch him away:
...my past power
Was purchased by no compact with thy crew.
{cont}"
"to the bartering of Faust's soul, and I have searched it in vain for the expression 'soul-murder'. But the essence and the secret of the whole work lies in―an incestuous relation between a brother and a sister. {cont}"
"and a little later a casual footnote occurs: 'Moreover, the name of Ahriman also appears in connection with a soul-murderer in, for example, Lord Byron's *Manfred*.' (20.) In the play which is thus referred to there is scarcely anything comparable {cont}"
"embodied in Goethe's *Faust*, Byron's *Manfred*, Weber's *Freischütz*, etc. (22), and one of these instances is further cited in another passage. In discussing the division of 'upper God' with Ahriman and Ormuzd respectively (19); {cont}"
but it was connected with matters of discretion which precluded their publication (as we see from the suppressed third chapter). From this point a single thread takes us further. Schreber illustrates the nature of soul-murder by referring to the legends {cont}
"The other accusation against Flechsig echoes over-loudly through the book. Flechsig, he says, tried to commit soul-murder upon him. As we already know, the patient was himself not clear as to the actual nature of that crime, {cont}"
"and *as such surrendered to the person in question* with a view to sexual abuse ...'¹ (56). It is unnecessary to remark that no other individual is ever named who could be put in Flechsig's place.
¹ The italics in this passage are mine. (12, 43-44)"
"when once my nervous complaint had been recognized as incurable or assumed to be so, *I should be handed over to a certain person* in such a manner that my soul should be transformed into a female body, {cont}"
"Indeed, it may be maintained that after all it is expressed openly in such a passage as the following: 'In this way a conspiracy against me was brought to a head (in about March or April, 1894). Its object was to contrive that, {cont}"
"since he was anxious not to insult the 'man Flechsig', he should have avoided so gross an accusation. But the toning-down of his language owing to these considerations did not go so far as to be able to conceal the true meaning of his accusation. {cont}"
"'But it is nowhere expressly stated that the transformation into a woman which he so much dreaded was to be carried out for the benefit of Flechsig.'―That is true; and it is not difficult to understand why, in preparing his memoirs for publication, {cont}"

"which have repeatedly been asserted to exist between the poet and his half-sister. And it is not a little striking that the action of Byron's other play, his celebrated *Cain*, should be laid in the primal family, {cont}"
"There is thus a direct contradiction of a soul having been bartered. This mistake on Schreber's part was probably not without its significance.―It is plausible, by the way, to connect the plot of *Manfred* with the incestuous relations {cont}"
"And here our thread breaks off short.²
² By way of substantiating the above assertion I will quote a passage from the last scene of the play, in which Manfred says to the demon who has come to fetch him away:
...my past power
Was purchased by no compact with thy crew.
{cont}"
"to the bartering of Faust's soul, and I have searched it in vain for the expression 'soul-murder'. But the essence and the secret of the whole work lies in―an incestuous relation between a brother and a sister. {cont}"
"and a little later a casual footnote occurs: 'Moreover, the name of Ahriman also appears in connection with a soul-murderer in, for example, Lord Byron's *Manfred*.' (20.) In the play which is thus referred to there is scarcely anything comparable {cont}"
"embodied in Goethe's *Faust*, Byron's *Manfred*, Weber's *Freischütz*, etc. (22), and one of these instances is further cited in another passage. In discussing the division of 'upper God' with Ahriman and Ormuzd respectively (19); {cont}"
but it was connected with matters of discretion which precluded their publication (as we see from the suppressed third chapter). From this point a single thread takes us further. Schreber illustrates the nature of soul-murder by referring to the legends {cont}
"The other accusation against Flechsig echoes over-loudly through the book. Flechsig, he says, tried to commit soul-murder upon him. As we already know, the patient was himself not clear as to the actual nature of that crime, {cont}"
"and *as such surrendered to the person in question* with a view to sexual abuse ...'¹ (56). It is unnecessary to remark that no other individual is ever named who could be put in Flechsig's place.
¹ The italics in this passage are mine. (12, 43-44)"
"when once my nervous complaint had been recognized as incurable or assumed to be so, *I should be handed over to a certain person* in such a manner that my soul should be transformed into a female body, {cont}"
"Indeed, it may be maintained that after all it is expressed openly in such a passage as the following: 'In this way a conspiracy against me was brought to a head (in about March or April, 1894). Its object was to contrive that, {cont}"
"since he was anxious not to insult the 'man Flechsig', he should have avoided so gross an accusation. But the toning-down of his language owing to these considerations did not go so far as to be able to conceal the true meaning of his accusation. {cont}"
"'But it is nowhere expressly stated that the transformation into a woman which he so much dreaded was to be carried out for the benefit of Flechsig.'―That is true; and it is not difficult to understand why, in preparing his memoirs for publication, {cont}"
"Psychiatrists should at last take a lesson from this patient, when they see him trying, in spite of his delusions, not to confuse the world of the unconscious with the world of reality. (12, 43)"
We will appeal to the distinction he himself draws between the man Flechsig and the 'Flechsig soul'. We are not making reproaches of any kind against him―whether for having had homosexual impulses or for having endeavoured to suppress them. {cont}
"'Yes, but he was not in his right mind when he did it. His delusion that he was being transformed into a woman was a pathological idea.'―We have not forgotten that. Indeed our only concern is with the meaning and origin of this pathological idea. {cont}"

"As regards my own behaviour, this often results in my being obliged in self-defence to play the part of a scoffer at God, and even, on occasion, to scoff at Him aloud.' (333.)²
² Even in the basic language {cont}"
"now that the miracles have to a great extent lost the power which they formerly possessed of producing terrifying effects, God strikes me above all, in almost everything that happens to me, as being ridiculous or childish. {cont}"
"He can therefore go on repeating the same tormenting ordeals and miracles and voices, without alteration, year after year, until He inevitably becomes a laughing-stock to the victim of His persecutions.
     'The consequence is that, {cont}"
"Furthermore, this singular God of Schreber's is incapable of learning anything by experience: 'Owing to some quality or other inherent in his nature, it seems to be impossible for God to derive any lessons for the future from the experience thus gained.' (186.) {cont}"
"to a specially high pitch of indignation. (12, 25-26)"
"and that the destruction of my understanding (the idiocy), for which He was hoping, had actually set in, and that a withdrawal had now become possible' (206).
     The behaviour of God in the matter of the urge to evacuate (or 'sh―') rouses him {cont}"
"To avoid being set down as an idiot, he submitted himself to an extremely burdensome system of 'enforced thinking'. For 'every time that my intellectual activities ceased, God jumped to the conclusion that my mental faculties were extinct {cont}"
"But as a result of God's misunderstanding of living men it was possible for Him Himself to become the instigator of the plot against Schreber, to take him for an idiot, and to subject him to these severe ordeals (264). {cont}"
"Through the whole of Schreber's book there runs the bitter complaint that God, being only accustomed to communication with the dead, *does not understand living men*. (12, 24-25)"
"This exceedingly rare occurrence took place in Schreber's case and involved him in the greatest sufferings. The instinct of self-preservation was aroused in God (30), and it then became evident that God was far removed from the perfection ascribed to him by religions. {cont}"
"the nerves of *living* men, especially when in a condition of *intense excitement*, may exercise such a powerful attraction upon the nerves of God that He cannot get free from them again, and thus His own existence may be threatened (11). {cont}"
"much remains of the doubter of yesterday.
     For there is a flaw in the Order of Things, as a result of which the existence of God Himself seems to be endangered. Owing to circumstances which are incapable of further explanation, {cont}"
"But any one who reads the account which follows of the character-traits of Schreber's God will have to allow that the transformation effected by the paranoic disorder was no very fundamental one, and that in the Redeemer of to-day {cont}"
"*This was not by any means so, however, in my case, as has been explained at the beginning of this chapter*.' (79.) (12, 24)"
"For illusions of holding communication with God or with departed souls can properly only arise in the minds of persons who, before falling into their condition of pathological nervous excitement, already have a firm belief in God and in the immortality of the soul. {cont}"
"Indeed, he adduces this fact about his earlier life as an argument in favour of the complete reality of his delusions.²
² 'That it was simply a matter of illusions, seems to me to be *in my case*, from the very nature of things, psychologically unthinkable. {cont}"
In the days before his illness Senatspräsident Schreber had been a doubter in religious matters (29 and 64); he had never been able to persuade himself into a firm belief in the existence of a personal God. {cont}

"it is rather a question of a ""must"" based upon the Order of Things, which there is no possibility of his evading, much as he would personally prefer to remain in his own honourable and masculine station in life. {cont}"
The most essential part of his mission of redemption is that it must be preceded by his *transformation into a woman*. It is not to be supposed that he *wishes* to be transformed into a woman; {cont}

"did he introduce topics which should more properly have been raised at a medical consultation,' (397-8.) Indeed, on one occasion during this period when a business question arose which involved the interests of his whole family,"
"He has a feeling that enormous numbers of ""female nerves"" have already passed over into his body, and out of them a new race of men will proceed, through a process of direct impregnation by God. Not until then, it seems, will he be able to die a natural death, {cont}"
"This is a matter of a process of development which will probably require decades, if not centuries, for its completion, and it is unlikely that anyone now living will survive to see the end of it. {cont}"
"But divine miracles (""rays"") always restored what had been destroyed, and therefore, as long as he remains a man, he is altogether immortal. These alarming phenomena have ceased long ago, and his ""femaleness"" has become prominent instead. {cont}"
"he lived for a long time without a stomach, without intestines, almost without lungs, with a torn oesophagus, without a bladder, and with shattered ribs, he used sometimes to swallow part of his own larynx with his food, etc. {cont}"
and he has had them confirmed by the voices that have conversed with him. During the first years of his illness certain of his bodily organs suffered such destructive injuries as would inevitably have led to the death of any other man: {cont}
"He himself, of this he is convinced, is the only object upon which divine miracles are worked, and he is thus the most remarkable human being who has ever lived upon earth. Every hour and every minute for years he has experienced these miracles in his body, {cont}"
But neither he nor the rest of mankind can regain the life beyond except by his being transformed into a woman (a process which may occupy many years or even decades) by means of divine miracles. {cont}
"it is rather a question of a ""must"" based upon the Order of Things, which there is no possibility of his evading, much as he would personally prefer to remain in his own honourable and masculine station in life. {cont}"
The most essential part of his mission of redemption is that it must be preceded by his *transformation into a woman*. It is not to be supposed that he *wishes* to be transformed into a woman; {cont}

or whether special constitutional conditions must be present in order that the organs may be led to an exaggeration of their erotogenic role and consequently provoke repression of the instincts. {cont}
"We may ask ourselves whether the suppression of sexual component instincts which is brought about by environmental influences is sufficient in itself to call up functional disturbances in organs, {cont}"
"we shall not regard it as improbable that *toxic* changes are also occurring in it. (11, 217-218)"

"'WILD' PSYCHO-ANALYSIS
(1910)
A FEW days ago a middle-aged lady, under the protection of a female friend, called upon me for a consultation, complaining of anxiety-states. She was in the second half of her forties, fairly well preserved, {cont}"
"We should have to see in those conditions the constitutional part of the disposition to fall ill of psychogenic and neurotic disorders. This is the factor to which, as applied to hysteria, I gave the provisional name of 'somatic compliance'. (11, 218)"
or whether special constitutional conditions must be present in order that the organs may be led to an exaggeration of their erotogenic role and consequently provoke repression of the instincts. {cont}
"We may ask ourselves whether the suppression of sexual component instincts which is brought about by environmental influences is sufficient in itself to call up functional disturbances in organs, {cont}"
"we shall not regard it as improbable that *toxic* changes are also occurring in it. (11, 217-218)"
"of its function in the service of the ego. Indeed, if we find that an organ normally serving the purpose of sense-perception begins to behave like an actual genital when its erotogenic role is increased, {cont}"
"If an organ which serves the two sorts of instinct increases its erotogenic role, it is in general to be expected that this will not occur without the excitability and innervation of the organ undergoing changes which will manifest themselves as disturbances {cont}"
"should alone protect it from this reproach. Psycho-analysts never forget that the mental is based on the organic, although their work can only carry them as far as this basis and not beyond it. (11, 217)"
"Psycho-analysis is unjustly reproached, Gentlemen, for leading to purely psychological theories of pathological problems. The emphasis which it lays on the pathogenic role of sexuality, which, after all, is certainly not an exclusively psychical factor, {cont}"
"and how the only man who peeped through the shutters at her revealed loveliness was punished by going blind. Nor is this the only example which suggests that neurotic illness holds the hidden key to mythology as well. (11, 217)"
"The beautiful legend of Lady Godiva tells how all the town's inhabitants hid behind their shuttered windows, so as to make easier the lady's task of riding naked through the streets in broad daylight, {cont}"

"The loss of conscious dominance over the organ is the detrimental substitute for the repression which had miscarried and was only made possible at that price. (11, 216)"
"The repressed instinct takes its revenge for being held back from further psychical expansion, by becoming able to extend its dominance over the organ that is in its service. {cont}"

"A SPECIAL TYPE OF CHOICE OF OBJECT MADE BY MEN

UP until now we have left it to the creative writer to depict for us the 'necessary conditions for loving' which govern people's choice of an object, {cont}"

archaic character of the expression of thoughts in dreams. And we psychiatrists cannot escape the suspicion that we should be better at understanding and translating the language of dreams if we knew more about the development of language.² {cont}
"In the correspondence between the peculiarity of the dream-work mentioned at the beginning of the paper and the practice discovered by philology in the oldest languages, we may see a confirmation of the view we have formed about the regressive, {cont}"
"If we take the other Indo-Germanic languages into consideration, the number of relevant instances grows accordingly; for example, *capere*―*packen*; *ren*―*Niere*; leaf―*folium*; *dum-a*, *θυμόϛ*―*mêdh*, *mûdha*, *Mut*; *rauchen*―*Kur-ít*; *kreischen―to shriek, etc.' (11, 160)"
"can be produced from the Aryan and Semitic languages as well. Confining ourselves in the first instance to Germanic languages we may note: *Topf*―pot; boat―tub; wait―*täuwen*; hurry―*Ruhe; care―reck; *Balken*―*Klobe*, club. {cont}"
"Let us suppose that the German word ""*gut*"" was Egyptian: it could then mean ""bad"" as well as ""good"", and be pronounced ""tug"" as well as ""gut"". Numerous examples of such reversals of sound, which are too frequent to be explained as chance occurrences, {cont}"
"For comparison with the dream-work there is another extremely strange characteristic of the ancient Egyptian language which is significant. 'In Egyptian, words can―apparently, we will say to begin with―*reverse their sound as well as their sense*. {cont}"
"and the English 'to lock' to the German '*Lücke*', '*Loch*'. We can compare the German '*kleben*' with the English 'to cleave' ('to split'); the German words '*stumm*' and '*Stimme*', and so on. (11, 159)"
"'*siccus*' ('dry')―'*succus*' ('juice'). In German '*Boden*' still means the highest as well as the lowest thing in the house. Our '*bös*' ('bad') is matched by a word '*bass*' ('good'); in Old Saxon '*bat*' ('good') corresponds to the English 'bad', {cont}"
"here accordingly we have the complete antithesis in meaning without any modification of the sound of the word. Phonetic alteration to distinguish contraries is illustrated by examples like '*clamare*' ('to cry')―'*clam*' ('softly', 'secretly'); {cont}"
"From the 'Appendix of Examples of Egyptian, Indo-Germanic and Arabic Antithetical Meanings' I select a few instances which may impress even those of us who are not experts in philology. In Latin '*altus*' means 'high' and 'deep', '*sacer*' 'sacred' and 'accursed'; {cont}"
"for although antithesis must have been present originally to the thinking minds of every race, it need not necessarily have become recognizable or have been retained everywhere in the meanings of words.' (11, 159)"
"Proof of the existence of contradictory primal meanings, which is easily established in Egyptian, extends, according to Abel, to the Semitic and Indo-European languages as well. 'How far this may happen in other language-groups remains to be seen; {cont}"

"A SPECIAL TYPE OF CHOICE OF OBJECT MADE BY MEN

archaic character of the expression of thoughts in dreams. And we psychiatrists cannot escape the suspicion that we should be better at understanding and translating the language of dreams if we knew more about the development of language.² {cont}
"In the correspondence between the peculiarity of the dream-work mentioned at the beginning of the paper and the practice discovered by philology in the oldest languages, we may see a confirmation of the view we have formed about the regressive, {cont}"
"If we take the other Indo-Germanic languages into consideration, the number of relevant instances grows accordingly; for example, *capere*―*packen*; *ren*―*Niere*; leaf―*folium*; *dum-a*, *θυμόϛ*―*mêdh*, *mûdha*, *Mut*; *rauchen*―*Kur-ít*; *kreischen―to shriek, etc.' (11, 160)"
"can be produced from the Aryan and Semitic languages as well. Confining ourselves in the first instance to Germanic languages we may note: *Topf*―pot; boat―tub; wait―*täuwen*; hurry―*Ruhe; care―reck; *Balken*―*Klobe*, club. {cont}"
"Let us suppose that the German word ""*gut*"" was Egyptian: it could then mean ""bad"" as well as ""good"", and be pronounced ""tug"" as well as ""gut"". Numerous examples of such reversals of sound, which are too frequent to be explained as chance occurrences, {cont}"
"For comparison with the dream-work there is another extremely strange characteristic of the ancient Egyptian language which is significant. 'In Egyptian, words can―apparently, we will say to begin with―*reverse their sound as well as their sense*. {cont}"
"and the English 'to lock' to the German '*Lücke*', '*Loch*'. We can compare the German '*kleben*' with the English 'to cleave' ('to split'); the German words '*stumm*' and '*Stimme*', and so on. (11, 159)"
"'*siccus*' ('dry')―'*succus*' ('juice'). In German '*Boden*' still means the highest as well as the lowest thing in the house. Our '*bös*' ('bad') is matched by a word '*bass*' ('good'); in Old Saxon '*bat*' ('good') corresponds to the English 'bad', {cont}"
"here accordingly we have the complete antithesis in meaning without any modification of the sound of the word. Phonetic alteration to distinguish contraries is illustrated by examples like '*clamare*' ('to cry')―'*clam*' ('softly', 'secretly'); {cont}"
"From the 'Appendix of Examples of Egyptian, Indo-Germanic and Arabic Antithetical Meanings' I select a few instances which may impress even those of us who are not experts in philology. In Latin '*altus*' means 'high' and 'deep', '*sacer*' 'sacred' and 'accursed'; {cont}"
"for although antithesis must have been present originally to the thinking minds of every race, it need not necessarily have become recognizable or have been retained everywhere in the meanings of words.' (11, 159)"
"Proof of the existence of contradictory primal meanings, which is easily established in Egyptian, extends, according to Abel, to the Semitic and Indo-European languages as well. 'How far this may happen in other language-groups remains to be seen; {cont}"
"The majority of other words with two meanings are similarly accompanied by explanatory pictures.' Abel thinks that in speech the desired meaning of the spoken word was indicated by gesture. (11, 158)"
"its sound, which is written alphabetically, is followed by the picture of an upright armed man; if the same word has to express ""weak"", the letters which represent the sound are followed by the picture of a squatting, limp figure. {cont}"
"In the written language this was done with the help of so-called 'determinative' signs which, placed after the alphabetical ones, assign their meaning to them and are not themselves intended to be spoken. (Ibid., 18): 'If the Egyptian word ""*ken*"" is to mean ""strong"", {cont}"
Since language serves not only to express one's own thoughts but essentially to communicate them to others the question may be raised how it was that the 'primal Egyptian' made his neighbour understand 'which side of the twin concept he meant on any particular occasion'. {cont}
"but only in order to use the compound to express the meaning of one of its contradictory parts―a part which would have had the same meaning by itself...' (11, 157)"
"mean only ""young"", ""near"", ""bind"", and ""inside"" respectively ... So that in these compound words contradictory concepts have been quite intentionally combined, not in order to produce a third concept, as occasionally happens in Chinese, {cont}"

GENTLEMEN,―Since the objects for which we are assembled here to-day are mainly practical, I shall choose a practical theme for my introductory address and appeal to your medical, not to your scientific, interest. {cont}"

"while it was being painted it was considered to be the highest that art could achieve, but it is certain that Leonardo himself was not satisfied with it, declaring it to be incomplete, and did not deliver it to the person who had commissioned it, {cont}"
and to retain the famous smile on her features. In its present condition the picture has preserved but little of all the delicate details which his brush reproduced on the canvas at that time; {cont}
"Leonardo spent four years painting at this picture, perhaps from 1503 to 1507, during his second period of residence in Florence, when he was over fifty. According to Vasari he employed the most elaborate artifices to keep the lady amused during the sittings {cont}"
"la grazia del inganno, la bontà che cela un proposito crudele, tutto ciò appariva alternativamente e scompariva dietro il velo ridente e si fondeva nel poema del suo sorriso ... Buona e malvagia, crudele e compassionevole, graziosa e felina, ella rideva ...' (11, 108-109)"
"The Italian writer Angelo Conti (1910, 93) saw the picture in the Louvre brought to life by a ray of sunshine. 'La donna sorrideva in una calma regale: i suoi i stinti di conquista, di ferocia, tutta l'eredità della specie, la volontà della seduzione e dell' agguato, {cont}"
"""a-t-il traduit ainsi l'essence même de la fémininité: tendresse et coquetterie, pudeur et sourde volupté, tout el mystère d'un coeur qui se réserve, d'un cerveau qui réfléchit, d'une personnalité qui se garde et ne livre d'elle-même que son rayonnement ...""' {cont}"
'On sait quelle énigme indéchiffrable et passionnante Monna Lisa Gioconda ne cesse depuis bientôt quatre siècles de proposer aux admirateurs pressés devant elle. Jamais artiste (j'emprunte la plume due délicat écrivain qui se cache sous le pseudonyme de Pierre de Corlay) {cont}
"the contrast between reserve and seduction, and between the most devoted tenderness and a sensuality that is ruthlessly demanding―consuming men as if they were alien beings. This is the view of Müntz (1899, 417): {cont}"
The idea that two distinct elements are combined in Mona Lisa's smile is one that has struck several critics. They accordingly find in the beautiful Florentine's expression the most perfect representation of the contrasts which dominate the erotic life of women; {cont}
"he will perhaps also discover something similar in the figures of Leonardo's teacher Verrocchio and therefore have some misgivings in accepting the arguments that follow.

We can now reconstruct the origin of Leonardo's vulture phantasy. He once happened to read in one of the Fathers or in a book on natural history the statement that all vultures were females and could reproduce their kind without any assistance from a male: {cont}
"Since the fable of the vulture could be turned to this account 'almost all' the Fathers of the Church made a practice of telling it, and thus it can hardly be doubted that Leonardo too came to know of it through its being favoured by so wide a patronage. (11, 89-90)"
"to confront those who doubted sacred history. If vultures were described in the best accounts of antiquity as depending on the wind for impregnation, why could not the same thing have also happened on one occasion with a human female? {cont}"
and their mode of conception remained something very far from an unimportant anecdote like the analogous tale of the scarabaeus beetle; it had been seized upon by the Fathers of the Church so that they could have at their disposal a proof drawn from natural history {cont}
"'Caeterum hanc fabulam de vulturibus cupide amplexi sunt Patres Ecclesiastici, ut ita argumento ex rerum natura petito refutarent eos, qui Virginis partum negabant; itaque apud omnes fere hujus rei mentio occurrit.'
     So the fable of the single sex vultures {cont}"
On proceeding further we come across a piece of information which can turn the probability that Leonardo knew the fable of the vulture into a certainty. The learned editor and commentator on Horapollo has the following note on the text already quoted above: {cont}
"'*μητέρα μέν, ἐπειδὴ ἄρρεν ἐν τούτψ τῷ γένει τῶν ζώων οὐχ ὑπάρχει.*'
³ Müntz (1899, 282).
⁴ Müntz (ibid.) (11, 89)"
"and all of them were already in print at the time. Milan was in fact the leading city in Italy for the new art of printing.
² *Horapollonis Niloi Hieroglyphica*, ed. Leemans (1835, 14). The words that refer to the vulture's sex run: {cont}"
"on other books that he had borrowed from friends; and if we may judge by the extracts from his notes by Richter,⁴ the extent of his reading can hardly be overestimated. Early works on natural history were well represented among them in addition to contemporary books; {cont}"
"as a pictorial representation of the idea of mother. He was a wide reader and his interest embraced all branches of literature and learning. In the Codex Atlanticus we find a catalogue of all the books he possessed at a particular date,³ and in addition numerous jottings {cont}"
reached a position where we can take something as very probable which only a short time before we had to reject as absurd. It is quite possible that Leonardo was familiar with the scientific fable which was responsible for the vulture being used by the Egyptians {cont}
"How then were vultures supposed to be impregnated if all of them were female? This is a point fully explained in a passage in Horapollo.² At a certain time these birds pause in mid-flight, open their vagina and are impregnated by the wind.
     We have now unexpectedly {cont}"
"ἀλλὰ θηλείαζ ἁπάσαζ.*' Quoted by von Römer (1903, 732).

"and at that point a memory sprang to his mind, which was transformed into the phantasy we have been discussing, but which meant to signify that he also had been such a vulture-child―he had had a mother, but no father. With this memory was associated, {cont}"
We can now reconstruct the origin of Leonardo's vulture phantasy. He once happened to read in one of the Fathers or in a book on natural history the statement that all vultures were females and could reproduce their kind without any assistance from a male: {cont}
"Since the fable of the vulture could be turned to this account 'almost all' the Fathers of the Church made a practice of telling it, and thus it can hardly be doubted that Leonardo too came to know of it through its being favoured by so wide a patronage. (11, 89-90)"
"to confront those who doubted sacred history. If vultures were described in the best accounts of antiquity as depending on the wind for impregnation, why could not the same thing have also happened on one occasion with a human female? {cont}"
and their mode of conception remained something very far from an unimportant anecdote like the analogous tale of the scarabaeus beetle; it had been seized upon by the Fathers of the Church so that they could have at their disposal a proof drawn from natural history {cont}
"'Caeterum hanc fabulam de vulturibus cupide amplexi sunt Patres Ecclesiastici, ut ita argumento ex rerum natura petito refutarent eos, qui Virginis partum negabant; itaque apud omnes fere hujus rei mentio occurrit.'
     So the fable of the single sex vultures {cont}"
On proceeding further we come across a piece of information which can turn the probability that Leonardo knew the fable of the vulture into a certainty. The learned editor and commentator on Horapollo has the following note on the text already quoted above: {cont}
"'*μητέρα μέν, ἐπειδὴ ἄρρεν ἐν τούτψ τῷ γένει τῶν ζώων οὐχ ὑπάρχει.*'

"and all of them were already in print at the time. Milan was in fact the leading city in Italy for the new art of printing.
² *Horapollonis Niloi Hieroglyphica*, ed. Leemans (1835, 14). The words that refer to the vulture's sex run: {cont}"
"on other books that he had borrowed from friends; and if we may judge by the extracts from his notes by Richter,⁴ the extent of his reading can hardly be overestimated. Early works on natural history were well represented among them in addition to contemporary books; {cont}"
"as a pictorial representation of the idea of mother. He was a wide reader and his interest embraced all branches of literature and learning. In the Codex Atlanticus we find a catalogue of all the books he possessed at a particular date,³ and in addition numerous jottings {cont}"
reached a position where we can take something as very probable which only a short time before we had to reject as absurd. It is quite possible that Leonardo was familiar with the scientific fable which was responsible for the vulture being used by the Egyptians {cont}
"How then were vultures supposed to be impregnated if all of them were female? This is a point fully explained in a passage in Horapollo.² At a certain time these birds pause in mid-flight, open their vagina and are impregnated by the wind.

"Leonardo could not become reconciled to fresco painting, which demands rapid work while the ground is still moist, and this was the reason why he chose oil colours, the drying of which permitted him to protract the completion of the painting to suit his mood and leisure. {cont}"
The slowness which had all along been conspicuous in Leonardo's work is seen to be a symptom of his inhibition and to be the forerunner of his subsequent withdrawal from painting.¹ It was this too which determined the fate of the Last Supper―a fate that was not undeserved. {cont}
"a wealth of possibilities between which a decision can only be reached with hesitation, demands which can hardly be satisfied, and an inhibition in the actual execution which is not in fact to be explained even by the artist inevitably falling short of his ideal. {cont}"

"He accompanied Cesare in a position of authority during the campaign that brought the Romagna in to the possession of that most ruthless and faithless of adversaries. There is not a line in Leonardo's notebooks which reveals any criticism of the events of those days, {cont}"
"Nor did it stop him from devising the cruellest offensive weapons and from entering the service of Cesare Borgia as chief military engineer. He often gave the appearance of being indifferent to good and evil, or he insisted on measurement by a special standard. {cont}"
but rather the worst of the wild beasts.² But this feminine delicacy of feeling did not deter him from accompanying condemned criminals on their way to execution in order to study their features distorted by fear and to sketch them in his notebook. {cont}
since he did not think it justifiable to deprive animals of their lives; and he took particular pleasure in buying birds in the market and setting them free.¹ He condemned war and bloodshed and described man as not so much the king of the animal world {cont}
"without the development of energetic aggressiveness towards other people―Leonardo was notable for his quiet peaceableness and his avoidance of all antagonism and controversy. He was gentle and kindly to everyone; he declined, it is said, to eat meat, {cont}"
The character of Leonardo the man showed some other unusual traits and apparent contradictions. A certain inactivity and indifference seemed obvious in him. At a time when everyone was trying to gain the widest scope for his activity―a goal unattainable {cont}
"and which he also abandoned in an unfinished condition. Here it seems as if an alien interest―in experimentation―at first reinforced the artistic one, only to damage the work later on. (11, 68)"
"The miscarriage of a similar technical experiment appears to have caused the destruction of the Battle of Anghiari, the painting which, in competition with Michelangelo, he began to paint some time afterwards on the wall of the Sala del Consiglio in Florence, {cont}"
"of the picture.²

"These pigments however detached themselves from the ground on which they were applied and which separated them from the wall. Added to this, the defects in the wall, and the later fortunes of the building itself, determined what seems to be the inevitable ruin {cont}"
"Leonardo could not become reconciled to fresco painting, which demands rapid work while the ground is still moist, and this was the reason why he chose oil colours, the drying of which permitted him to protract the completion of the painting to suit his mood and leisure. {cont}"
The slowness which had all along been conspicuous in Leonardo's work is seen to be a symptom of his inhibition and to be the forerunner of his subsequent withdrawal from painting.¹ It was this too which determined the fate of the Last Supper―a fate that was not undeserved. {cont}
"a wealth of possibilities between which a decision can only be reached with hesitation, demands which can hardly be satisfied, and an inhibition in the actual execution which is not in fact to be explained even by the artist inevitably falling short of his ideal. {cont}"
"we are bound totally to reject the idea that traits of hastiness and unsteadiness acquired the slightest influence over Leonardo's relation to his art. On the contrary, it is possible to observe a quite extraordinary profundity, {cont}"
"If these reports of the way in which Leonardo worked are compared with the evidence of the extraordinarily numerous sketches and studies which he left behind him and which exhibit every *motif* appearing in his paintings in a great variety of forms, {cont}"

"Another sexual satisfaction at this period of life is the masturbatory excitation of the genitals, which retains so much importance in later life and by many people is never completely conquered. (11, 44)"

"Put away your doubts, then, and join me in a consideration of infantile sexuality from the earliest age.² A child's sexual instinct turns out to be put together out of a number of factors; {cont}"
"and they do not wish to be reminded of what has been repressed. They would arrive at other convictions if they were to begin their enquiry with a self-analysis, a revision and interpretation of their childhood memories. (11, 43)"
"It is only too easy to explain why most people (whether medical observers or others) will hear nothing of the sexual life of children. They have forgotten their own infantile sexual activity under the pressure of their education to a civilized life, {cont}"
"There is even no difficulty in observing the manifestations of these sexual activities in children; on the contrary, it calls for some skill to overlook them or explain them away. (11, 41-42)"
"it comes into the world with them; and, after an important course of development passing through many stages, they lead to what is known as the normal sexuality of the adult. {cont}"
"No, Gentlemen, it is certainly not the case that the sexual instinct enters into children at the age of puberty in the way in which, in the Gospel, the devil entered into the swine. A child has its sexual instincts and activities from the first; {cont}"

"Others of a child's sexual activities already imply the making of an 'object-choice', where an extraneous person becomes the main feature, a person who owes his importance in the first instance to considerations arising from the self-preservative instinct. {cont}"
"from the former of which curiosity branches off later on and from the latter the impulsion to artistic and theatrical display. (11, 44)"
"These instincts occur in pairs of opposites, active and passive. I may mention as the most important representatives of this group the desire to cause pain (sadism) with its passive counterpart (masochism) and the active and passive desire for looking, {cont}"
"Alongside these and other auto-erotic activities, we find in children at a very early age manifestations of those instinctual components of sexual pleasure (or, as we like to say, of libido) which pre-suppose the taking of an extraneous person as an object. {cont}"
"Another sexual satisfaction at this period of life is the masturbatory excitation of the genitals, which retains so much importance in later life and by many people is never completely conquered. (11, 44)"
"We call the parts of the body that are important in the acquisition of sexual pleasure 'erotogenic zones'. Thumb-sucking (or sensual sucking) in the youngest infants is a good example of this auto-erotic satisfaction from an erotogenic zone. (11, 44)"
"Since at this first phase of infantile sexual life satisfaction is obtained from the subject's own body and extraneous objects are disregarded, we term this phase (from a word coined by Havelock Ellis) that of *auto-erotism*. {cont}"
"It serves for the acquisition of different kinds of pleasurable feeling, which, basing ourselves on analogies and connections, we bring together under the idea of sexual pleasure.

"Put away your doubts, then, and join me in a consideration of infantile sexuality from the earliest age.² A child's sexual instinct turns out to be put together out of a number of factors; {cont}"
"and they do not wish to be reminded of what has been repressed. They would arrive at other convictions if they were to begin their enquiry with a self-analysis, a revision and interpretation of their childhood memories. (11, 43)"
"It is only too easy to explain why most people (whether medical observers or others) will hear nothing of the sexual life of children. They have forgotten their own infantile sexual activity under the pressure of their education to a civilized life, {cont}"

"It is well known that the ancient world did not share this low opinion of dreams. Nor are the lower strata of our own society to-day in any doubt about the value of dreams; like the peoples of antiquity, they expect them to reveal the future. {cont}"
"Our dismissal of them is related to the uninhibited shamelessness and immorality of the tendencies openly exhibited in some dreams. (11, 34)"
"We dismiss them, too, by forgetting them as a rule, quickly and completely. Our low opinion of them is based on the strange character even of those dreams that are not confused and meaningless, and on the obvious absurdity and nonsensicalness of other dreams. {cont}"
I invite you now to follow me on a brief excursion through the region of dream-problems. When we are awake we are in the habit of treating dreams with the same contempt with which patients regard the associations that are demanded of them by the psycho-analyst. {cont}
"otherwise than as a layman. You may comfortably count almost all psychiatrists among such laymen. (11, 33-34)"
"There is nothing paradoxical in the assertion that no one who regards these 'normal' illusions, delusions and character-changes with astonishment instead of comprehension has the slightest prospect of understanding the abnormal structures of pathological mental states {cont}"
"You should bear in mind that the dreams which we produce at night have, on the one hand, the greatest external similarity and internal kinship with the creations of insanity, and are, on the other hand, compatible with complete health in waking life. {cont}"
"with the most superficial objections. If, on the contrary, you can accept the solutions of the problems of dream-life, the novelties with which psycho-analysis confronts your minds will offer you no further difficulties. (11, 33)"
"If I am asked how one can become a psycho-analyst, I reply: 'By studying one's own dreams.' Every opponent of psycho-analysis hitherto has, with a nice discrimination, either evaded any consideration of *The Interpretation of Dreams*, or has sought to skirt over it {cont}"
"The interpretation of dreams is in fact the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious; it is the surest foundation of psycho-analysis and the field in which every worker must acquire his convictions and seek his training. (11, 33)"
"before you could possibly know the importance that can attach to that antiquated and derided art.
¹ *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1900*a*). (11, 33)"
"I was held back by a purely subjective and seemingly secondary motive. It seemed to me almost indecent in a country which is devoted to practical aims to make my appearance as a 'dream-interpreter', {cont}"
"I must admit, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I hesitated for a long time whether, instead of giving you this condensed general survey of the whole field of psycho-analysis, it might not be better to present you with a detailed account of dream-interpretation.¹ {cont}"
"the interpretation of patients' dreams and the exploitation of their faulty and haphazard actions. (11, 33)"
Working over the ideas that occur to patients when they submit to the main rule of psycho-analysis is not our only technical method of discovering the unconscious. The same purpose is served by two other procedures: {cont}
"but it is indispensable for the objective demonstration of complexes and in the examination of the psychoses, which has been embarked on with so much success by the Zurich school. (11, 32-33)"
as it has been developed by Jung (1906) and his pupils. This procedure offers the psycho-analyst what qualitative analysis offers the chemist. In the treatment of neurotic patients it can be dispensed with; {cont}
"If you are anxious to gain a rapid and provisional knowledge of a patient's repressed complexes, without as yet entering into their arrangement and interconnection, you will employ as a method of examination the 'association experiment' {cont}"
"as it were, as ore from which, with the help of some simple interpretive devices, he extracts its content of precious metal. (11, 32)"
"I confess that I feel no necessity for making any mystical assumptions in order to fill the gaps in our present knowledge, and accordingly I have never been able to find anything to confirm the prophetic nature of dreams. {cont}"
"It is well known that the ancient world did not share this low opinion of dreams. Nor are the lower strata of our own society to-day in any doubt about the value of dreams; like the peoples of antiquity, they expect them to reveal the future. {cont}"
"Our dismissal of them is related to the uninhibited shamelessness and immorality of the tendencies openly exhibited in some dreams. (11, 34)"
"We dismiss them, too, by forgetting them as a rule, quickly and completely. Our low opinion of them is based on the strange character even of those dreams that are not confused and meaningless, and on the obvious absurdity and nonsensicalness of other dreams. {cont}"
I invite you now to follow me on a brief excursion through the region of dream-problems. When we are awake we are in the habit of treating dreams with the same contempt with which patients regard the associations that are demanded of them by the psycho-analyst. {cont}
"otherwise than as a layman. You may comfortably count almost all psychiatrists among such laymen. (11, 33-34)"
"There is nothing paradoxical in the assertion that no one who regards these 'normal' illusions, delusions and character-changes with astonishment instead of comprehension has the slightest prospect of understanding the abnormal structures of pathological mental states {cont}"
"You should bear in mind that the dreams which we produce at night have, on the one hand, the greatest external similarity and internal kinship with the creations of insanity, and are, on the other hand, compatible with complete health in waking life. {cont}"
"with the most superficial objections. If, on the contrary, you can accept the solutions of the problems of dream-life, the novelties with which psycho-analysis confronts your minds will offer you no further difficulties. (11, 33)"
"If I am asked how one can become a psycho-analyst, I reply: 'By studying one's own dreams.' Every opponent of psycho-analysis hitherto has, with a nice discrimination, either evaded any consideration of *The Interpretation of Dreams*, or has sought to skirt over it {cont}"
"The interpretation of dreams is in fact the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious; it is the surest foundation of psycho-analysis and the field in which every worker must acquire his convictions and seek his training. (11, 33)"
"before you could possibly know the importance that can attach to that antiquated and derided art.
¹ *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1900*a*). (11, 33)"
"I was held back by a purely subjective and seemingly secondary motive. It seemed to me almost indecent in a country which is devoted to practical aims to make my appearance as a 'dream-interpreter', {cont}"
"I must admit, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I hesitated for a long time whether, instead of giving you this condensed general survey of the whole field of psycho-analysis, it might not be better to present you with a detailed account of dream-interpretation.¹ {cont}"
"the interpretation of patients' dreams and the exploitation of their faulty and haphazard actions. (11, 33)"
Working over the ideas that occur to patients when they submit to the main rule of psycho-analysis is not our only technical method of discovering the unconscious. The same purpose is served by two other procedures: {cont}
"but it is indispensable for the objective demonstration of complexes and in the examination of the psychoses, which has been embarked on with so much success by the Zurich school. (11, 32-33)"
as it has been developed by Jung (1906) and his pupils. This procedure offers the psycho-analyst what qualitative analysis offers the chemist. In the treatment of neurotic patients it can be dispensed with; {cont}
"If you are anxious to gain a rapid and provisional knowledge of a patient's repressed complexes, without as yet entering into their arrangement and interconnection, you will employ as a method of examination the 'association experiment' {cont}"
"as it were, as ore from which, with the help of some simple interpretive devices, he extracts its content of precious metal. (11, 32)"
"This associative material, which the patient contemptuously rejects when he is under the influence of the resistance instead of under the doctor's, serves the psycho-analyst, {cont}"
"and above all if he finds it disagreeable to let himself think about what has occurred to him. So long as this ordinance is carried out we are certain of obtaining the material which will put us on the track of the repressed complexes. (11, 32)"
"of this behaviour and requiring him to take no notice of such criticisms. He must, we tell him, entirely renounce any critical selection of this kind and say whatever comes into his head, even if he considers it incorrect or irrelevant or nonsensical, {cont}"
"or gets rid of the idea that he has become aware of, under the influence of the resistances which disguise themselves as various critical judgements about the value of the idea that has occurred to him. We can protect ourselves against this by warning him beforehand {cont}"
"If this were so and if the patient were right, then our procedure would once again have proved ineffective. But closer observation shows that such stoppage of the flow of ideas never in fact occurs. It *appears* to happen only because the patient holds back {cont}"
"When we come to putting this procedure into effect, we are subject to yet another interference. For the patient will often pause and come to a stop, and assert that he can think of nothing to say, and that nothing whatever occurs to his mind. {cont}"
"If this method of discovering what is repressed strikes you as unduly circumstantial, I can at least assure you that it is the only practicable one. (11, 31-32)"
"at our disposal. Accordingly, we allow the patient to say whatever he likes, and hold fast to the postulate that nothing can occur to him which is not in an indirect fashion dependent on the complex we are in search of. {cont}"
"We see, then, that if in our search for a repressed complex in one of our patients we start out from the last thing he remembers, we shall have every prospect of discovering the complex, provided that the patient puts a sufficient number of his free associations {cont}"
"It is highly convenient, Ladies and Gentlemen, to follow the Zurich school (Bleuler, Jung, etc.) in describing a group of interdependent ideational elements cathected with affect as a 'complex'. {cont}"
"and the same state of things is responsible for our patients' producing a more or less distorted *substitute* instead of the forgotten idea we are in search of.

One might easily meet with the fate which I suggested in my last lecture as an analogy for repression. That was the reason why the critic did not express the insult he had in mind directly but in the form of an 'allusion accompanied by omission'; {cont}

I found confirmation of the fact that the forgotten memories were not lost. They were in the patient's possession and were ready to emerge in association to what was still known by him; but there was some force that prevented them from becoming conscious {cont}

I was set the task of learning from the patient something that I did not know and that he did not know himself. How could one hope to elicit it? But there came to my help a recollection of a most remarkable and instructive experiment which I had witnessed {cont}
"At first, I must confess, this seemed a senseless and hopeless undertaking. (11, 22)"

"Next morning she said to her governess, 'There's no Santa Claus. Daddy and Mummy do it. Now I don't believe in anything at all any more, not even in the stork. Daddy and Mummy do that, too.' The other story was about his little nephew aged seven. {cont}"
He told me two charming stories of children. One was about a little girl of five or six who was very curious about Santa Claus. She pretended to be asleep and saw her father and mother filling shoes and stockings with apples and pears. {cont}
"In a dream he had met a captain who only had his badge of rank on the right side and one of the three stars was hanging down. He pointed out the analogy with his cousin's operation. (10, 295)"

     His formula 'Glejsamen', in which in a happy hour he fixed by a magic spell what was henceforth to continue unchanged, had held good, he said, for quite a time. But it was nevertheless exposed to the enemy, that is, {cont}"

"he was actually asked this question. He is quite certain about this dream, but there is no evidence of his having spoken of it during the interval.
     He tried to explain the previous dream by the fact that his friend had no money {cont}"
"(V) During the summer of 1903, while he was working for his Third State Examination.
     He dreamt that he was asked in the examination to explain the different between a '*Bevollmächtigter*' and a '*Staatsorgan*'. Some months later, in his Finals, {cont}"
"Had the postman by any chance brought a parcel for him? No.―Then minutes later the door-bell rang: the postman had brought his tobacco. (10, 268-269)"
(IV) In the summer of 1901 he had written to one of his colleagues to send him 3 *kronen's* worth of pipe tobacco. Three weeks passed wit no reply and no tobacco. One morning he woke up and said he had dreamt of tobacco. {cont}
"(The two views exist side by side, but the critical one is sterile.) (10, 268)"
"which made him profoundly wretched.
     He could not help believing in the premonitory power of dreams, for he had had several remarkable experiences to prove it. Consciously he does not really believe in it. {cont}"
"I tried to swim after them but she held me back: 'Let the rags go!' I stood there in gorgeous raiment.
     He knew that the rags meant his illness and that the whole dream promised him health through the lady. He was very happy at the time―till other dreams came {cont}"
She put her arm through mine and dragged me away by force. I struggled with her but she was too strong. We came to a broad river and she stood there. I was dressed in miserable rags which fell into the stream and were carried away by it. {cont}
"(III) He cherished this third dream as though it were his most precious treasure.
     Dec.―Jan., 1907. I was in a wood and most melancholy. The lady came to meet me, looking very pale. 'Paul, come with me before it is too late. I know we are both sufferers.' {cont}"
"who (as he told me in answer to an enquiry) is very happily married. It is possible that the maid, who is in the habit of dusting his room while he is still asleep, may have touched the coins and so made a noise which penetrated into his sleep. (10, 267-268)"
"though his words could not possibly have any other meaning.)
     The Japanese swords really exist. They hang at the head of his bed and are made of a very large number of Japanese coins. They were a present from his eldest sister at Trieste, {cont}"
"Either he set her free from this situation by means of his two swords, 'marriage' and 'copulation': or the other idea was that it was only on account of them that she had got into this situation. (It was clear that he himself did not understand this alternative, {cont}"
"where he suspected she was. He knew that they meant 'marriage' and 'copulation'. Both things now came true. He found her leaning up against a wall, with thumb-screws fastened to her. The dream seemed to him now to become ambiguous. {cont}"
"(II) In October, 1906―perhaps after masturbating on the occasion of reading the passage in *Wahrheit und Dichtung*.
     The lady was under some kind of restraint. He took his two Japanese swords and set her free. Clutching them, he hurried to the place {cont}"
"for he sets much store by dreams and they have played a large part in his story and have even led up to crises. (10, 267)"
"at the very moment of the stroking.
     (The dream was not interpreted. For it is in fact only a more distinct version of the obsessional idea which he did not dare to become aware of during the day.)
     He was greatly affected by to-day's dream, {cont}"
"It was as though I tried to shake off her embrace, as though each time she stroked my head some misfortune would occur to the lady―some misfortune in the next world too. It happened automatically―as though the misfortune occurred {cont}"
"His dream during the night said much more distinctly what was thus lightly touched on while he was awake:―
     (I) Reserl was stopping with us. She got up as though she was hypnotized, came behind my chair with a pale face and put her arms around me. {cont}"

(IV) In the summer of 1901 he had written to one of his colleagues to send him 3 *kronen's* worth of pipe tobacco. Three weeks passed wit no reply and no tobacco. One morning he woke up and said he had dreamt of tobacco. {cont}
"(The two views exist side by side, but the critical one is sterile.) (10, 268)"
"which made him profoundly wretched.
     He could not help believing in the premonitory power of dreams, for he had had several remarkable experiences to prove it. Consciously he does not really believe in it. {cont}"
"I tried to swim after them but she held me back: 'Let the rags go!' I stood there in gorgeous raiment.
     He knew that the rags meant his illness and that the whole dream promised him health through the lady. He was very happy at the time―till other dreams came {cont}"
She put her arm through mine and dragged me away by force. I struggled with her but she was too strong. We came to a broad river and she stood there. I was dressed in miserable rags which fell into the stream and were carried away by it. {cont}
"(III) He cherished this third dream as though it were his most precious treasure.
     Dec.―Jan., 1907. I was in a wood and most melancholy. The lady came to meet me, looking very pale. 'Paul, come with me before it is too late. I know we are both sufferers.' {cont}"
"who (as he told me in answer to an enquiry) is very happily married. It is possible that the maid, who is in the habit of dusting his room while he is still asleep, may have touched the coins and so made a noise which penetrated into his sleep. (10, 267-268)"
"though his words could not possibly have any other meaning.)
     The Japanese swords really exist. They hang at the head of his bed and are made of a very large number of Japanese coins. They were a present from his eldest sister at Trieste, {cont}"
"Either he set her free from this situation by means of his two swords, 'marriage' and 'copulation': or the other idea was that it was only on account of them that she had got into this situation. (It was clear that he himself did not understand this alternative, {cont}"
"where he suspected she was. He knew that they meant 'marriage' and 'copulation'. Both things now came true. He found her leaning up against a wall, with thumb-screws fastened to her. The dream seemed to him now to become ambiguous. {cont}"
"(II) In October, 1906―perhaps after masturbating on the occasion of reading the passage in *Wahrheit und Dichtung*.
     The lady was under some kind of restraint. He took his two Japanese swords and set her free. Clutching them, he hurried to the place {cont}"
"for he sets much store by dreams and they have played a large part in his story and have even led up to crises. (10, 267)"
"at the very moment of the stroking.
     (The dream was not interpreted. For it is in fact only a more distinct version of the obsessional idea which he did not dare to become aware of during the day.)
     He was greatly affected by to-day's dream, {cont}"
"It was as though I tried to shake off her embrace, as though each time she stroked my head some misfortune would occur to the lady―some misfortune in the next world too. It happened automatically―as though the misfortune occurred {cont}"
"His dream during the night said much more distinctly what was thus lightly touched on while he was awake:―
     (I) Reserl was stopping with us. She got up as though she was hypnotized, came behind my chair with a pale face and put her arms around me. {cont}"
"I explained to him the principle of the Adige at Verona, which he found most illuminating. (10, 265)"
"'Where is Katherine?' and going into the room and finding his father sitting in an arm-chair and crying. The third was of his father bending over his weeping mother. (It is curious that I am not certain whether these memories are his or Ph.'s.) (10, 264)"
"I have not mentioned from earlier sessions three inter-related memories dating from his fourth year, which he describes as his earliest ones and which refer to the death of his elder sister Katherine. The first was of her being carried to bed. The second was of his asking {cont}"
"It was always the same with him: his fine or happy moments were always spoilt by something nasty. I drew his attention to the analogy between this and assassinations instigated by *agents provocateurs*. (10, 261)"

"They are not purely reasonable considerations arising in opposition to the obsessional thoughts, but, as it were, hybrids between the two species of thinking; they accept certain of the premises of the obsession they are combating, and thus, {cont}"
"into his consciousness, psychical structures make their appearance which deserve to be given a special name. (Such, for example, were the sequences of thoughts that occupied our patient's mind on his journey back from the manœuvres.) {cont}"
"It must be confessed, moreover, that even the phenomenology of obsessional thinking has not yet had sufficient attention paid to it. During the secondary defensive struggle, which the patient carries on against the 'obsessional ideas' that have forced their way {cont}"
"between the repressed ideas and the repressing ones.' In the definition, that is to say, especial stress is to be laid on the word 'transformed'. (10, 221-222)"
"and the self-reproaches formed from them never re-emerge into consciousness unchanged: what become conscious as obsessional ideas and affects, and take the place of the pathogenic memories so far as conscious life is concerned, are structures in the nature of a compromise {cont}"

"that obsessional structures can correspond to every sort of psychical act. They can be classed as wishes, temptations, impulses, reflections, doubts, commands, or prohibitions. Patients endeavour in general to tone down such distinctions and to regard what remains {cont}"
"with their characteristic liking for indeterminateness, they heap together under the name of 'obsessional ideas' the most heterogeneous psychical structures.³ In point of fact, it would be more correct to speak of 'obsessive thinking', and to make it clear {cont}"

And another time it happened when he read in *Dichtung und Wahrheit* how the young Goethe had freed himself in a burst of tenderness from the effects of a curse which a jealous mistress had pronounced upon the next woman who should kiss his lips after her; {cont}
"in the middle of Vienna, he heard a postilion blowing his horn in the most wonderful way―until a policeman stopped him, because blowing horns is not allowed in the centre of town. (10, 203)"
"From that time onwards it reappeared only upon rare and extraordinary occasions. It was provoked, he told me, when he experienced especially fine moments, or when he read especially fine passages. It occurred once, for instance, on a lovely summer's afternoon when, {cont}"
"an impulsion towards masturbatory activities came over him in his twenty-first year, *shortly after his father's death*. He felt very much ashamed of himself each time he gave way to this kind of gratification, and soon foreswore the habit. {cont}"
"Our present patient's behaviour in the matter of masturbation was most remarkable. He did not practise it during puberty and therefore, according to one set of views, he might have expected to be exempt from neurosis. On the other hand, {cont}"

² This dream provides the explanation of the compulsive laughter {cont}"
"He once brought me a dream which represented the same conflict in relation to his transference on to the physician. He dreamt that my mother was dead; he was anxious to offer me his condolences, but was afraid that in doing so he might break into *an impertinent laugh*, {cont}"
"the similar mechanism in the familiar case of sacrilegious thoughts entering the minds of devout persons. (10, 193)"
"In the end he found his way out of his embarrassment by giving up the prayers and replacing them by a short formula concocted out of the initial letters or syllables of various prayers. He then recited this formula so quickly that nothing could slip into it.

"On one such occasion the idea occurred to him of cursing instead, for in that case, he thought, the contrary words would be sure to creep in. His original intention, which had been repressed by his praying, was forcing its way through in this last idea of his. {cont}"
"The reason for this was that he found, like an inverted Balaam, that something always inserted itself into his pious phrases and turned them into their opposite. E.g., if he said, 'May God protect him', an evil spirit would hurriedly insinuate a 'not'.¹ {cont}"
"The conflict between love and hatred showed itself in our patient by other signs as well. At the time of the revival of his piety he made up prayers for himself, which took up more and more time and eventually lasted for an hour and a half. {cont}"
"which he carried out under compulsion, had clothed itself to his conscious view with the motives that really belonged to the first and philanthropic one. (10, 192-193)"

¹ It cannot be doubted that another contributory motive to this compulsive idea was a wish to know that she was powerless {cont}"

"The mutual antagonism between his feelings for his lady was too marked to have escaped his conscious perception entirely, although we may conclude from the obsessions in which it was manifested that he did not rightly appreciate the depth of his negative impulses. {cont}"

"the similar mechanism in the familiar case of sacrilegious thoughts entering the minds of devout persons. (10, 193)"
"In the end he found his way out of his embarrassment by giving up the prayers and replacing them by a short formula concocted out of the initial letters or syllables of various prayers. He then recited this formula so quickly that nothing could slip into it.

"On one such occasion the idea occurred to him of cursing instead, for in that case, he thought, the contrary words would be sure to creep in. His original intention, which had been repressed by his praying, was forcing its way through in this last idea of his. {cont}"
"The reason for this was that he found, like an inverted Balaam, that something always inserted itself into his pious phrases and turned them into their opposite. E.g., if he said, 'May God protect him', an evil spirit would hurriedly insinuate a 'not'.¹ {cont}"
"The conflict between love and hatred showed itself in our patient by other signs as well. At the time of the revival of his piety he made up prayers for himself, which took up more and more time and eventually lasted for an hour and a half. {cont}"

"Was there any guarantee, he next enquired, of what one's attitude would be towards what was discovered? One man, he thought, would no doubt behave in such a way as to get the better of his self-reproach, but another would not.―No, I said, {cont}"

"when he must know that as a matter of fact he had never committed any crime against him? (10, 175-176)"
"that this new way of looking at the matter gave immediate rise to some hard problems; for how could he admit that his self-reproach of being a criminal towards his father is justified, {cont}"

"In this connection I said a word or two upon the good opinion I had formed of him, and this gave him visible pleasure. (10, 178)"
by logic?―I told him I did not dispute the gravity of his case nor the significance of his pathological constructions; but at the same time his youth was very much in his favour as well as the intactness of his personality. {cont}
"He found nothing more to say in this immediate connection, but instead he expressed a doubt whether it was possible to undo modifications of such long standing. What, in particular, could be done against his idea about the next world, for it could not be refuted {cont}"
"it was a discovery which I should be glad to let him make for himself.― (10, 177-178)"
"become *repressed*. It was the derivatives of this repressed unconscious that were responsible for the involuntary thoughts which constituted his illness. He might now, I added, discover yet another characteristic of the unconscious; {cont}"
"namely, its relation to the *infantile*. The unconscious, I explained, *was* the infantile; it was that part of the self which had become separated off from it in infancy, which had not shared the later stages of its development, and which had in consequence {cont}"
"He then said that, though he considered himself a moral person, he could quite definitely remember having done things in his *childhood* which came from his other self.―I remarked that here he had incidentally hit upon one of the chief characteristics of the unconscious, {cont}"
"between the conscious and the unconscious. The moral self as the conscious, the evil self was the unconscious.¹―
¹ All of this is of course only true in the roughest way, but it serves as a first introduction to the subject. (10, 177)"
"of his life, perhaps more of one than most people.―I replied that I was in complete agreement with this notion of a splitting of his personality. He had only to assimilate this new contrast, between a moral self and an evil one, with the contrast I had already mentioned, {cont}"
"Such an occurrence, he continued, was thus only possible where a *disintegration of the personality* was already present. Was there a possibility of his effecting a re-integration of his personality? If this could be done, he thought he would be able to make a success {cont}"
"He had said to himself, he went on, that a self-reproach could only arise from a breach of a person's own inner moral principles and not from that of any external ones.―I agreed, and said that the man who merely breaks an external law often regards himself as a hero.― (10, 177)"
"it followed from the nature of the circumstances that in every case the affect would be overcome―for the most part during the progress of the work itself. Every effort was made to preserve Pompeii, whereas people were anxious to be rid of tormenting ideas like his.― (10, 177)"
"Was there any guarantee, he next enquired, of what one's attitude would be towards what was discovered? One man, he thought, would no doubt behave in such a way as to get the better of his self-reproach, but another would not.―No, I said, {cont}"
"and I illustrated my remarks by pointing to the antiques standing about in my room. They were, in fact, I said, only objects found in a tomb, and their burial had been their preservation: the destruction of Pompeii was only beginning now that it had been dug up.― (10, 176)"
"upon *the psychological differences between the conscious and the unconscious*, and upon the fact that everything conscious was subject to a process of wearing-away, while what was unconscious was relatively unchangeable; {cont}"
"that it was not the information that had this effect, but the discovery of the unknown content to which the self-reproach was really attached.―Yes, he said, that was the precise point to which his question had been directed.―I then made some short observations {cont}"
"At the next session the patient showed great interest in what I had said, but ventured, so he told me, to bring forward a few doubts.―How, he asked, could the information that the self-reproach, the sense of guilt, was justified have a therapeutic effect?―I explained {cont}"
"when he must know that as a matter of fact he had never committed any crime against him? (10, 175-176)"
"that this new way of looking at the matter gave immediate rise to some hard problems; for how could he admit that his self-reproach of being a criminal towards his father is justified, {cont}"
"when they cannot catch the right murderer, arrest a wrong one instead. Moreover, this fact of there being a false connection is the only way of accounting for the powerlessness of logical processes to combat the tormenting idea.' I concluded by admitting {cont}"
"We are not used to feeling strong affects without their having any ideational content, and therefore, if the content is missing, we seize as a substitute upon some other content which is in some way or other suitable, much as our police, {cont}"
"The sense of guilt is not in itself open to further critcism. But it belongs to some other content, which is unknown (*unconscious*), and which requires to be looked for. The known ideational content has only got into its actual position owing to a false connection. {cont}"
"that the affect is too great for the occasion―that it is exaggerated―and that consequently the inference following from the self-reproach (the inference that the patient is a criminal) is false. On the contrary, the physician says: 'No. The affect is justified. {cont}"

"At first, however, the reproach had not tormented him. For a long time he had not realized the fact of his father's death. It had constantly happened that, when he heard a good joke, he would say to himself: 'I must tell Father that.' His imagination, too, {cont}"
"and the reproach had been intensified when the nurse told him that his father had spoken his name once during the last days, and had said to her as she came up to the bed: 'Is that Paul?' (10, 174)"
"that limit. At half-past eleven at night he had lain down for an hour's rest. He had woken up at one o'clock, and had been told by a medical friend that his father had died. He had reproached himself with not having been present at his death; {cont}"
"One evening, thinking that the condition was one which would come to a crisis, he had asked the doctor when the danger could be regarded as over. 'The evening of the day after to-morrow', had been the reply. It had never entered his head that his father might not survive {cont}"
"'I have decided to tell you something which I consider most important and which has tormented me from the very first.' He then told me at great length the story of the last illness of his father, who had died of emphysema nine years previously. {cont}"

"POSTSCRIPT (1922)
A few months ago―in the spring of 1922―a young man introduced himself to me and informed me that he was the 'little Hans' whose infantile neurosis had been the subject of the paper which I published in 1909. I was very glad to see him again, {cont}"
"and to suppose that the multiplicity of the phenomena of repression exhibited by neuroses and the abundance of their pathogenic material do not prevent their being derived from a very limited number of processes concerned with identical ideational complexes. (10, 147)"
"But the neuroses of these other patients could in every instance be traced back to the same infantile complexes that were revealed behind Hans's phobia. I am therefore tempted to claim for this neurosis of childhood the significance of being a type and a model, {cont}"
"Strictly speaking, I learnt nothing new from this analysis, nothing that I had not already been able to discover (though often less distinctly and more indirectly) from other patients analysed at a more advanced age. {cont}"
"of a small number of favoured individuals who have not been required to suppress their instincts. Nor has any one enquired by what means and at what cost the suppression of the inconvenient instincts has been achieved. (10, 146)"
"Hitherto education has only set itself the task of controlling, or, it would often be more proper to say, of suppressing, the instincts. The results have been by no means gratifying, and where the process has succeeded it has only been to the advantage {cont}"
"in the opposite direction,―all of these are things which have been said so often and have met with so much agreement that I am certainly not alone in maintaining their truth. (10, 145-146)"
"before the threshold of this summation is overstepped, and that consequently a number of individuals are constantly passing from the class of healthy people into that of neurotic patients, while a far smaller number also make the journey {cont}"
"That no sharp line can be drawn between 'neurotic' and 'normal' people―whether children or adults―that our conception of 'disease' is a purely practical one and a question of summation, that predisposition and the eventualities of life must combine {cont}"
"By this I do not, of course, mean to contradict the expectation that consciousness in this more limited sense of the word must also fulfill some biological function. (10, 145)"

"POSTSCRIPT (1922)
A few months ago―in the spring of 1922―a young man introduced himself to me and informed me that he was the 'little Hans' whose infantile neurosis had been the subject of the paper which I published in 1909. I was very glad to see him again, {cont}"
"and to suppose that the multiplicity of the phenomena of repression exhibited by neuroses and the abundance of their pathogenic material do not prevent their being derived from a very limited number of processes concerned with identical ideational complexes. (10, 147)"
"But the neuroses of these other patients could in every instance be traced back to the same infantile complexes that were revealed behind Hans's phobia. I am therefore tempted to claim for this neurosis of childhood the significance of being a type and a model, {cont}"
"Strictly speaking, I learnt nothing new from this analysis, nothing that I had not already been able to discover (though often less distinctly and more indirectly) from other patients analysed at a more advanced age. {cont}"
"of a small number of favoured individuals who have not been required to suppress their instincts. Nor has any one enquired by what means and at what cost the suppression of the inconvenient instincts has been achieved. (10, 146)"
"Hitherto education has only set itself the task of controlling, or, it would often be more proper to say, of suppressing, the instincts. The results have been by no means gratifying, and where the process has succeeded it has only been to the advantage {cont}"
"in the opposite direction,―all of these are things which have been said so often and have met with so much agreement that I am certainly not alone in maintaining their truth. (10, 145-146)"
"before the threshold of this summation is overstepped, and that consequently a number of individuals are constantly passing from the class of healthy people into that of neurotic patients, while a far smaller number also make the journey {cont}"
"That no sharp line can be drawn between 'neurotic' and 'normal' people―whether children or adults―that our conception of 'disease' is a purely practical one and a question of summation, that predisposition and the eventualities of life must combine {cont}"
"By this I do not, of course, mean to contradict the expectation that consciousness in this more limited sense of the word must also fulfill some biological function. (10, 145)"
as are capable of consciousness. We know that thought processes of this kind may also take place *preconsciously*; and it is wiser to regard their actual 'consciousness' from a pure phenomenological standpoint. {cont}
"and that with its entrance upon the scene an important advantage is secured.¹
¹ (*Footnote added* 1923:) I am here using the word 'consciousness' in a sense which I later avoided, namely, to describe our normal processes of thought―such, that is, {cont}"
"by a temperate and purposeful control on the part of the highest agencies of the mind. In a word, *analysis replaces repression by condemnation*. This seems to bring us the long-looked-for evidence that consciousness has a biological function, {cont}"
"For analysis does not undo the *effects* of repression. The instincts which were formerly suppressed remain suppressed; but the same effect is produced in a different way. Analysis replaces the process of repression, which is an automatic and excessive one, {cont}"
"if they shut their patients' mouths as soon as they begin to talk about their complexes or their derivatives? For the only alternative source of knowledge remaining open to them are my own writings and those of my adherents. (10, 144)"
"keep back an astonished question. Where do my opponents obtain their knowledge, which they produce with so much confidence, on the question whether the repressed sexual instincts play a part, and if so what part, in the aetiology of the neuroses, {cont}"
"to Dogberry's, when he advised the Watch to avoid all contact with any thieves they might happen to meet: 'for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.'¹

"Wise men like these are being no more than consistent when they implore us for heaven's sake not to meddle with the evil things that lurk behind a neurosis. In doing so they forget, it is true, that they are physicians, and their words bear a fatal resemblance {cont}"
"or did his evil intentions against his father give place to evil deeds? Such misgivings will no doubt have occurred to many doctors, who misunderstand the nature of psycho-analysis and think that wicked instincts are strengthened by being made conscious. {cont}"
But I must now enquire what harm was done to Hans by dragging into light in him complexes such as are not only repressed by children but dreaded by their parents. Did the little boy proceed to take some serious action as regards what he wanted from his mother? {cont}
"but I do not know if many others will share my opinion; nor do I know whether experience will prove me right. (10, 143-144)"
"which must always be of some significance for a child's later life, and which undoubtedly brings with it a certain degree of deformity of character if not a predisposition to a subsequent neurosis. I am inclined to think that this is so, {cont}"
"to overcome the innate instinctual components of his mind; and his trouble brought his father to his assistance. It may be that Hans now enjoys an advantage over other children, in that he no longer carries with him that seed in the shape of repressed complexes {cont}"
I can therefore quite imagine that it may have been to Hans's advantage to have produced this phobia. For it directed his parents' attention to the unavoidable difficulties by which a child is confronted when in the course of his cultural training he is called upon {cont}
"in short, at training up a model child, and we pay very little attention to whether such a course of development is for the child's good as well. (10, 143)"
"It seems to me that we concentrate too much upon symptoms and concern ourselves too little with their causes. In bringing up children we aim only at being left in peace and having no difficulties, {cont}"
"but since he was brought up without being intimidated, and with as much consideration and as little coercion as possible, his anxiety dared to show itself more boldly. (10, 142-143)"
"the first symptom of those conflicts has persisted or has retreated under the pressure of circumstances. I think, therefore, that Hans's illness may perhaps have been no more serious than that of many other children who are not branded as 'degenerates'; {cont}"
"such as we have been discussing, and is in fact a continuation of it; so that, as it were, a continuous and undisturbed thread of psychical activity, taking its start from the conflicts of his childhood, has been spun through his life―irrespective of whether {cont}"

"which had in common the qualities of being violent and forbidden, and the content of which strikes us as fitting in most remarkably well with the hidden truth. We can only say that they were symbolic phantasies of intercourse, and it was no irrelevant detail {cont}"
"Some kind of vague notion was struggling in the child's mind of something that he might do with his mother by means of which his taking possession of her would be consummated; for this elusive thought he found certain pictorial representations, {cont}"
"In an analysis, however, a thing which has not been understood inevitably reappears; like an unlaid ghost, it cannot rest until the mystery has been solved and the spell broken. (10, 122)"
"Therapeutic success, however, is not our primary aim; we endeavour rather to enable the patient to obtain a conscious grasp of his unconscious wishes. (10, 120)"
"The child dreamt of exchanging endearments with his mother and of sleeping with her; but all the pleasure was transformed into anxiety, and all the ideational content into its opposite. Repression had defeated the purpose of the mechanism of dreaming. (10, 118)"

it seems merely to imply a postponement and does not indicate that further efforts will be in vain. The ideal case of a resistance {cont}

and if in place of it defensive reactions appear. In that case the sexually exciting speech becomes an aim in itself in the shape {cont}

has been accomplished. Here the displacement is part of the work which has created the joke; it is not part of the work necessary {cont}

"to find the transition from one thought to another―a transition which, stretching a point, might be equated with a displacement. {cont}"

"do not greatly impress us. They may remind us, perhaps, of the way in which some housewives economize when they spend time and money {cont}"
"to a solution of our problem. And let us, further, have the courage to admit that the economies made by the joke-technique {cont}"
and until we know the nature of that peculiarity our discovery of the common element in the techniques of jokes brings us no nearer {cont}
There must therefore be some peculiar kind of abbreviation and economy on which the characteristic of being a joke depends; {cont}
and raised the justifiable objection that a laconic remark is not enough to constitute a joke [p. 28]. {cont}
"We reached this point once before, when we were still hoping to find the process of condensation in every joke, {cont}"
"but the relation is not reversible. Not every economy of expression, not every abbreviation, is on that account a joke as well. {cont}"
which has a right to be heard. It may be that every joke-technique shows the tendency to save something in expression; {cont}
"as where it comes from, what it signifies and how the joke's yield of pleasure arises from it, we must find space for a doubt {cont}"
But before we accept the 'tendency to economy' as the most general characteristic of the technique of jokes and ask such questions {cont}

Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. [I, 2.] (8, 43-44)"
The multiple use of the same words for question and answer is certainly an 'economy'. Like Hamlet's view of the rapid sequence {cont}

ANYONE who has at any time had occasion {cont}"
"and offering fore-pleasures can alone determine the limits set upon the employment of abnormal characters on the stage. (7, 310)"
"In general, it may perhaps be said that the neurotic instability of the public and the dramatist's skill in avoiding resistances {cont}"
"and pronounce the character inadmissible to the stage. (7, 310)"
"by an unfamiliar and fully established neurosis, we shall be inclined to send for the doctor (just as we do in real life) {cont}"
and this represents a step further than *Hamlet* in the use of neurosis on the stage. If we are faced {cont}
This will be especially necessary where the repression does not already exist in us but has first to be set up; {cont}
in *us*; and this can best be achieved if we are made to follow the development of the illness along with the sufferer. {cont}
"just as, if he himself recognizes it, he ceases to be ill. It would seem to be the dramatist's business to induce the same illness {cont}"
"if we first meet it in a fully established state. But, *per contra*, if we recognize the conflict, we forget that he is a sick man, {cont}"
on the stage as they are in real life. For the victim of a neurosis is someone into whose conflict we can gain no insight {cont}
It may be in consequence of disregarding these three pre-conditions that so many other psychopathic characters are as unserviceable {cont}
"to do so. After all, the conflict in *Hamlet* is so effectively concealed that it was left to me to unearth it. (7, 309-310)"
"of the repressed material reaching consciousness, owing to a lower resistance, while the repressed material itself is unable {cont}"
"A certain amount of resistance is no doubt saved in this way, just as, in an analytic treatment, we find derivatives {cont}"

"into consciousness, however clearly it is recognizable, is never given a definite name; so that in the spectator too the process {cont}"
can have no reason to lose'. (3) It appears as a necessary precondition of this form of art that the impulse that is struggling {cont}
"in the hero: we are susceptible to the same conflict as he is, since 'a person who does not lose his reason under certain conditions {cont}"
which is shaken up by the situation of the play. As a result of these two characteristics it is easy to recognize ourselves {cont}
and the repression of which is part and parcel of the foundations of our personal evolution. It is this repression {cont}
"in the course of the action of the play. (2) The repressed impulse is one of those which are similarly repressed in all of us, {cont}"

The first of these modern dramas is *Hamlet*. It has as its subject the way in which a man who has so far been normal becomes {cont}

is brought about. Thus it is only in neurotics that a struggle can occur of a kind which can be made the subject of a drama; {cont}
"it is unstable and needs a constant renewal of expenditure, and this expenditure is spared if recognition of the impulse {cont}"
has been enough to hold the repressed impulse completely in check. But in neurotics the repression is on the brink of failing; {cont}

to the problem of the psychoneuroses and of the neuroses in general. No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock {cont}

The symptoms of the disease are nothing else than *the patient's sexual activity*. A single case can never be capable of proving {cont}

     I was further anxious to show that sexuality does not simply intervene, {cont}"
no obstacle can remain in the way of an understanding of a therapeutic method which removes neurotic symptoms by transforming ideas {cont}
"and which have ideas attaching to them of which we become conscious. When once things have been made clear up to this point, {cont}"
"run a different course, and manifest themselves differently from those other excitations which we describe as 'normal' {cont}"

"if her father refused to give way to her, I was quite sure she would not let herself be deprived of her illness so easily. (7, 42)"
and she would certainly not fail on every future occasion to make use once more of her liability to ill-health. Yet {cont}

that she had an aim in view which she hoped to gain by her illness. That aim could be none other than to detach her father {cont}

I was obliged to point out to the patient that her present ill-health was just as much actuated by motives {cont}

In analyses of this kind which I conduct on myself I find two things particularly striking: {cont}
"and with the same result; but the content of the majority of cases is so intimate that they cannot be reported. (6, 243)"
"Since this first example in which an apparently arbitrarily chosen number was explained I have often repeated the same experiment, {cont}"
"from the unconscious.' (6, 242-243)"

I was obviously annoyed at having failed to get very far myself during the period in which I have followed Colonel M.'s career; {cont}
"In other words, in answer to the question whether *I* meant to retire too, my wish gave me another twenty-four years' work. {cont}"
"So that was in 1880, or nineteen years ago. That gives you the ""24"" in 2467. Now take my present age―43―add 24, and you have 67. {cont}"
"to prove it. I celebrated my majority, i.e. my twenty-fourth birthday, under military arrest (having been absent without leave). {cont}"
"But the earlier train of thought went on in my mind, and with good reason. I had miscalculated; I have a fixed point in my memory {cont}"

"Assuming that it was in 1882 that I saw him in hospital, it must have been seventeen years. I told my wife this and she remarked: {cont}"
"having become Master of Ordnance, and is already (1899) on the retired list. I wanted to work out how long he had taken over this. {cont}"
"After that episode I decided to follow his career, and lo and behold! now he has reached the end of it, {cont}"
"to the medical officer: 'You must make me well in a week, because I have some work to do for which the Emperor is waiting.' {cont}"
While I was serving as a medical officer-cadet he came to the sick quarters one day (he was then a colonel) and said {cont}
that a General E. M. had retired from the post of Master of Ordnance. I should explain that I am interested in this man. {cont}

THE FORGETTING OF PROPER NAMES
     In the 1898 volume of the *Monatsschrift für Psychiatrie und Neurologie* I published {cont}"
"for condensation, displacement and dramatization. (5, 685)"
it is in all probability a characteristic of the unconscious thinking which provides the dream-work with the material {cont}
between dreams and these latter productions. We must not suppose that dream-symbolism is a creation of the dream-work; {cont}
"on representation in fairy-tales, myths and legends, in jokes and in folk-lore. It enables us to trace the intimate connections {cont}"
"Dream-symbolism extends far beyond dreams: it is not peculiar to dreams, but exercises a similar dominating influence {cont}"
"of the highest mental agencies. (5, 682)"
"the sexual instincts are also the one which, in most people, find it easiest to escape from the control {cont}"
"of instincts has been submitted to such far-reaching suppression by the demands of cultural education, while at the same time {cont}"
There is no theoretical necessity why this should be so; but to explain the fact it may be pointed out that no other group {cont}
"stimulus by providing another explanation of it and has thus sought to prolong sleep, even if only for a moment. (5, 681)"
Every dream which occurs immediately before the sleeper is woken by a loud noise has made an attempt at explaining away the arousing {cont}
"and must regard dreams as *the guardians of sleep*. (5, 678)"
"of dreams. It is commonly said that sleep is disturbed by dreams; strangely enough, we are led to a contrary view {cont}"
"to alterations in repressed material made by the censorship, we shall no longer have any difficulty in discovering the *function* {cont}"

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DREAM-PROCESSES
