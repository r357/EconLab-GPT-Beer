"Over time, outer 20 will have ~300 tons of thrust & inner 8 ~210, so roughly 7500 tons total at sea level or 1.5 T/W for booster+ship"
Yeah
Just go through resonant modes fast. It‚Äôs when you hang out there that problems arise.
"The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC & differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever."

"Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind."
"Yeah, he sent it to me through a mutual physics prof friend at Caltech/CERN. Very basic stuff."

"It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas & underweight bringing them to fruition. For example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard."
"People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions & a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect."
That & Giga Berlin are why I‚Äôm headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines & cures in many areas.
"Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low & symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells"
Yeah
"One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife & Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was."
"Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn‚Äôt blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval."

Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.
"People read too much into this level of detail. It‚Äôs not useful for predicting the future, nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term, fine-grained level."
Critical feedback is always appreciated btw
"We can‚Äôt have a blanket pass, but maybe for some events"
"Booster design has shifted to four legs with a wider stance (to avoid engine plume impingement in vacuum), rather than six"
Later versions of a larger device would have that potential
Yup
"Actually C, although the syntax could be improved esthetically"
"I like C, because it avoids class warfare"

"Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust."

Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory & super high bandwidth between cores & efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
No & not possible at this scale

"Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise."

"Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not."
Your insights over the years have been excellent. That‚Äôs approximately right.
"Absolutely, but it doesn‚Äôt seem that govt can move fast enough"
Ok
It will blow ur mind haha
"Our main engineering locations are Palo Alto, Austin & Seattle, but working remotely is acceptable for exceptional candidates"
"I want to do electric vtol supersonic sooo bad, but my brain will overload"
"Asteroid impact risk is well understood, but not comets. Those worry me."
Great mission patch design!
Haha true
Yup
Exactly
"Also definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didn‚Äôt have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily."
"Sorry, this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now."
"Yes! We‚Äôre labeling bumps & potholes, so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so."
"Not perfectly at first, but yes. Will take maybe a year or so to get really good at roundabouts worldwide. The world has a zillion weird corner cases."
This is what I meant by ‚Äú4D‚Äù
"The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it‚Äôs a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home & work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks."
Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. It‚Äôs a beast! Please consider joining our AI or computer/chip teams if this sounds interesting.
More software improvements coming
"Significant improvements coming to S/X air suspension soon via software update! Will simultaneously improve performance handling & ride comfort & enable user customization of height & damping, geocoded for relevance."
"H2O, CH4/CO2, N2, iron, nickel, chrome, aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel"
What are the odds  ?
"The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point."
Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production
SN8
Impressive
Psyche
"Yes, integrated with the tip of the nose"
This is important
Probably not faster than utility power can be restored. Powerwall/Powerpack/Megapack can certainly be helpful long-term.
Starship fairing will actually have more height than shown here. Dome will be flatter & more of tip is accessible. Usable volume ~1000 cubic meters.
You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.
So why is this madness acceptable for Boeing/Lockheed rockets?
Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once & then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd
I generally try my best not to be on patents
"Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary & ‚Äúspace power‚Äù. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money."
"Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails."

That bs was pushed by oil & gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. Bernard Sanders is a docile puppet of big oil!

"Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies."
üíØ
"Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short"
"Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height."
I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
It will look crazy tall with booster & fairing at 122m / 394 ft
Ok
"Apart from failing to quarantine elderly/at-risk people early (a mistake they recognize), they were right"
Good piece on Giga Berlin construction
This seems increasingly likely
This is gonna be great
SN5
"We‚Äôll do several short hops to smooth out launch process, then go high altitude with body flaps"
Soon
"V1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider & taller ‚Äî like Falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces & auto-leveling."
Progress is accelerating

Astronauts land in 2 hours @NASA @SpaceX
"However, we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover"
"All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes."
Great game

"Neuralinks are currently meant for mature brains & functionality is lost if removed. Rewiring of neurons is certainly possible, but won‚Äôt make up for loss of the Link."
"Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups & restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device."
Will show neurons firing in real-time on August 28th. The matrix in the matrix.
They don‚Äôt fire all at once. Some go several seconds to minutes without firing. Some fire several times per second. Very wide timing distribution.

"Nice work, SpaceX team!"
Still long way to go. Reuse only matters to degree that it‚Äôs rapid & complete.
Too long since we were last there
Launch in 20 mins
In a few months in production release. Already does that in alpha build.
Lithium is extremely common on Earth. Found almost everywhere.
Congratulations MHI & UAE!

New deep crimson from Giga Berlin is my favorite
Important to service very high latitudes

Reusability is essential. A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane. F9 engines already fire 3 times per flight.

"Yes, Angela, please show us the graphs/data that prove your point"
"I‚Äôm not building anything on ethereum. Not for or against it, just don‚Äôt use it or own any."
Lithium is common. Hard part is turning lithium salt or clay into extremely pure LiOH.
"Yes, at Tesla Grohmann"
"Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac & possibly others"
"In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem."
"As you‚Äôd expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy."
Seems fishy
ü§£ü§£ very true
"A lot of functionality will happen all at once when we transition to the new software stack. Most likely, it will be releasable in 2 to 4 months. Then it‚Äôs a question of what functionality is proven safe enough to enable for owners."
"Going well. Team is kicking ass & it‚Äôs an honor to work with them. Pretty much everything had to be rewritten, including our labeling software, so that it‚Äôs fundamentally ‚Äú3D‚Äù at every step from training through inference."
Crassus was a dick

I love Texas! Starship production complex is in Boca Chica & SpaceX engine development has been in McGregor for almost 18 years.
Aiming for 10km with lots of turns to better approximate a real-world tunnel
"You just have to be a shareholder. There is limited space, so sign up fast when we do final confirmation of date & location."
"Wow, I‚Äôve never seen this level of support! Out of respect, seems like I should at least visit."
We need to finish building a much longer vacuum tunnel for speed tests & probably have an additional competition for tunneling itself
"All questions will be answered on Battery Day, Sept 15th. Will be webcast, although there is much to see in person."

"Extremely big difference between died because of or died with. Also, did the person actually have C19 or did they just have C19 symptoms? It‚Äôs almost impossible to die without feeling weakness, shortness of breath or other C19 symptoms, unless you were crushed by a falling piano."
Your GPS just got slightly better
This bill needs to be revoked. It gives absurd power to county bureaucrats.
"If accurate, this would explain a lot"
Levitt is right
"There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none."
Very much agree
Good hygiene always makes sense
True
Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
"There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations & mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest."
"Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla."

Looks pretty cool
Could be slightly faster
Two Starship tanks in the midbay
Ok
Special thanks to Tesla trucking & rail partners for figuratively & literally going the extra mile
Apologies to Tesla customers for shifting delivery dates. It‚Äôs a crazy world out there!

Maybe Incat
There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch & landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.

Looking likely
"Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner ‚Äústiffness‚Äù, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out."
"Tank didn‚Äôt burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result & supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We‚Äôre developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
"Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that‚Äôs already mixed."
Yes
"That‚Äôs the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points."
Accurate
Sure
"Around 20ms. It‚Äôs designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency."
It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in & point at sky. Can be done in either order.
Congratulations Kathy!

Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers & improving fast
"Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2."
"We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights."

"Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha."
Absolutely
"Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results & latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible."
"Wow, this is extremely important!!"

"I‚Äôm not messing around. Absurd & medically irrational behavior in violation of constitutional civil liberties, moreover by *unelected* county officials with no accountability, needs to stop."
"Much appreciated, Mayor Fine!"
Thanks Mayor Mei!
Absolutely
Please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with @AlamedaCounty
"Yes, already done"
Yes
Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California & second biggest exporter
Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
"Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county."
"San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible & reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational & detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada."
"Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA."
"Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected & ignorant ‚ÄúInterim Health Officer‚Äù of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!"
"No, I have a license!"
B-nut ü§£
"Half a üêù, philosophically, must ipso facto half not üêù"
Turns out hobbits are enormous
"Once again, I must recommend"
Glad we could help
It‚Äôs true
Coming soon
"Yes, this is a high priority"
"Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%"
"Pain can certainly be turned off, but we‚Äôre not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet"
Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car

That‚Äôs harder than it sounds. Will check with team.

"No, but it‚Äôs mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)"
"It‚Äôs not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal."
"To be clear, I do think finance & law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs."
"Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)"
Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
"Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg."
ü§£ü§£
"That‚Äôs pretty much what happened. The cows weren‚Äôt sure what to do (not having encountered a rocket before), so first ran one direction, then the other."
A mandatory tracing app would be insane
True
Probably makes sense to have a ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes ü§£ü§£
Would cover latitude of London
Yes
"Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms."
"It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator"
Sure :)

Yeah!!
"A fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc."
SLS makes me feel sad
"No, they will be smashed beyond repair & corroded"
"Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine"
A great mystery of the universe
It‚Äôs so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
"Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!"
"Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars & maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life."
"In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid"
"Yes, converts CO2 & H2O to CH4 & O2. Perfect for Mars!"
"Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we‚Äôll be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack."
Turns on city street intersections is the big one
Yes. Static fire feeding from fuel header vs main tank.
Not SpaceX
His son sounds great btw
2008 was a super tough year on all levels
"Tesla & SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That‚Äôs why."
Good for them! About half the US will be mostly open by this weekend.

"It‚Äôs true, the pressure bulkheads are too pointy"
Starship SN4 passed static fire
"Happy, healthy & cute as a button :)"
This person is wrong. Why does JD want to believe he got cucked so bad anyway!?
There would be time-stamped video if this were true

"Science is simply rigorous pursuit of truth. Quality of reasoning is all that matters, which means a ten-year-old could be more correct than a physics Nobel Prize winner."
That would be awesome
"This is false. JD‚Äôs team put out ‚Äúvideo evidence‚Äù, but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD & AH had separated."
"Yeah, definitely a future feature"
Levitt rocks
"Important to distinguish died with covid vs died because of covid. Also, distinguish between tested positive for covid or only had symptoms."
Utter moron
Thanks! Something more should be done. This guy has caused massive strife to the world with his absurdly fake ‚Äúscience‚Äù.

Nope. Thanks!
Thanks :) Never too young for some ink haha
Boy

Weird that EPA would deny this. We have precise car logs that confirm it happened. Happy to provide them.
I hope anything lands
It seems unlikely right now
Mostly accurate. Liquid CH4 temp got too high this time. Offloading propellant. Will we retry later today.
Thanks!
Commentary is quite entertaining! MST3K
SN4 üî• soon. Raptor looks so sm≈çl.
Good chance it accelerates viral vaccines & cures

"A little. Will have 31 engines, not 37, no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at 200 ton, but upgrades in the works for 250 ton."
Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pok√©mon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?
Minecraft has amazing legs
That was 2.5 years ago & still not even on the moon. Progress must accelerate!
Pretty much
What excites you about 2030?

Don‚Äôt need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession just weigh you down.
My gf @Grimezsz is mad at me
Just one stipulation on sale: I own Gene Wilder‚Äôs old house. It cannot be torn down or lose any its soul.
"Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness"
Exactly. How cheaply freedom is sold.
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
"Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave"
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
"And the rocket's red glare,

Static fire with Raptor hopefully later this week

Snowing in Texas
Cryo test underway
Dark mode makes Twitter feel like night
How is it considered probable if there‚Äôs no covid test? Is just a cough or high temperature enough?
So dark out there
Would be helpful to distinguish deaths caused by covid vs unrelated to covid!

Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
Docs make good points
"Yes, switching soon to a 300 series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp. 301 is good as sheet, but not as plate. Also, a lot of geometric changes."
Not yet
Successive iteration of both design & manufacturing. Latter is 1000% harder than former.
It‚Äôs a little dicey tbh. Thrust dome is being redesigned. Current one has four separate layers of steel in some places!
150m
Physically ready in a few weeks. Approvals may take longer.
Aiming for cryo pressure test tonight
SN4 passed ambient pressure test

Heard same from doc I trust
"No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad"
That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
So often true ü§£ü§£
Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time & reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
These won‚Äôt be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.

Great labeling tools & talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools & infrastructure is underrated.
"As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is >1000% harder than designing it"
It‚Äôs also because of the Spitfire engine & wizard
Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
Progress is good
Definitely
Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame & actuation.
"Sure, we can probably do an update later this year"
Needs to be more than halfway to east coast
"Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity"
Yes
Yes
I agree
Mythic Quest is ü§£ü§£ MTTD
Mean Time To Dick is a key measure of any given human or machine intelligence system
Merlin is very simple compared to Raptor
Width currently limited by size of cold-roll press needed to get steel to full hard condition. Bigger press will be built long-term.
Absolutely
Great questions from Hack Club!

"Yes, same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities & mortality proportionate to age."
Silver lining is that mortality rate is much lower than predicted & herd immunity much higher. Good news.
Maybe Cybertruck will have it
"I‚Äôm dying to do super efficient, quiet home HVAC with HEPA & water distillation. It‚Äôs weird, but I really want to do it."
Good one
Will talk with team. We have a lot on our plate!
"Side camera view looks a little weird, as meant for self-driving, but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing."
"That is more reasonable, especially if mostly loans. Oil & gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time, but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy."
So shall we all

Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle & all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
Makes sense
Nice
Anything surprising?
Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
"When I talked to doctors in Wuhan, they recommended against invasive ventilators & in favor of non-invasive"

"I sure hope so! This will inspire the world & get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn‚Äôt just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind."
"Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter."
Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
Probably 3 to 6 months
"Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as ‚Äúventilator‚Äù, but makes many good points"
You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive & non-invasive. It‚Äôs very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are ‚Äúreal ventilators‚Äù.

.@GavinNewsom please fix this misunderstanding

What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
‚ÄúDr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning‚Äù. Yup.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt jump to intubation.‚Äù ‚Äî Dr Caputo
"A mask or nose ‚Äúventilator‚Äù with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation & you‚Äôre fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable."
Sounds about right
Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I‚Äôm hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
"I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington"
We‚Äôre working super hard on getting traffic lights & stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
"They were, but are they currently?"
Interesting
"We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty."
Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
Sure
"Production is by *far* the hard part. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they‚Äôre pretty sweet"
"SN4 won‚Äôt get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator & static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps."

I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It‚Äôs very hard. I‚Äôm spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done üòÄ
My (again) personal favorite is
"Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn‚Äôt scale to bigger rockets & is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it‚Äôs probably right move for small LEO vehicle."
"Vast majority of ‚Äúventilators‚Äù are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient‚Äôs throat & driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2."
SN26
"Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It‚Äôs a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!"
"The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!"
"Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch"
"Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage & payload separation system also not US."
"Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips & Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation & setting PEEP & O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage."
"Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%."
"Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!"
"Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
"Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often & is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."
"Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That‚Äôs the acid test."
"True. Only reason other medium & heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they‚Äôd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying."
"To be clear, Fremont & Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it‚Äôs hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop"
Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
That‚Äôs for sure! üòÖ

"Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, we‚Äôre going to reuse much of the thrust section."
"Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe."
"Rockets & spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo."
There are redundant pressure control valves. It‚Äôs a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
"If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you‚Äôre doomed anyway, so might as well go all in"
We‚Äôre adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
"Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2."

We‚Äôre going to simplify Plaid a little. Was getting too complex.
"Oh sure, good point. Will discuss with team & make available to buy in Tesla app."
Some progress
"Yeah, probably July 1st"
Hoping to roll out traffic lights & stops to wide US release in a few weeks & probably WW release in Q3 (so many variations in each country!). Very important to make sure this is done right.
"Homelink is 3rd party hardware that increases cost of all cars, but only some people use it, so it‚Äôs only installed upon request. Long-term, garage openers are transitioning to WiFi-activated."
Monty Python & Mel Brooks are my all-time favorites
Northwell seems to be very pragmatic & sensible. Impressive work in difficult circumstances.

"Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low."
"Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight."

Happy we could be helpful! More available if needed.
"Mass of initial SN ships will be a little high & Isp a little low, but, over time, it will be ~150t to LEO fully reusable"
"We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device & shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or @Tesla know."

Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include ‚Äúestimated illness onset date‚Äù. This is a significantly less rigorous standard.
C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.

"Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water & just dump it on the ground."
"Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority & LAX customs for acting so swiftly"
"Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!"
"Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car & know when you‚Äôre expected home, so temp & humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy."
This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
"Sure would love to do home hvac that‚Äôs quiet & efficient, with humidity control & HEPA filter"
Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast & extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.
The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond

Have you seen more data on HCQ & Z-Pak? Hard to find.
Worrisome
Yup
We‚Äôll try to get & deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
Nice
This is great advice
Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there‚Äôs anything else you need.
"We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed & operating is the harder part."
Supply chain logistics ‚Äî getting masks & other PPE to the right places in time  ‚Äî is the main issue we‚Äôre hearing from ER physicians
You‚Äôre most welcome. We‚Äôre working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
Panic is always dumb
"Italy: ‚ÄúOn re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.‚Äù"
"Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors"
We have N95 masks & getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.

"Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too."
Up to 80% false positive
"Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."
Do you have data on the false positive rate? I‚Äôve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and ‚Äúpresumed positive‚Äù.

"Some parts will use 304L, as it has higher toughness at cryo temps. Will move to internally developed alloys probably end of year."
Probably. Raptor sounds different to Merlin.
Lot of Raptors coming through! Now operating both horizontal & vertical firing stands in McGregor.
Sure
Will discuss with team
Yes
Once production has exceeded preorders
Yes
True
Pretty much
Coming soon
The Permian-Triassic was super bad
"To be totally frank, I did an image search on my phone & posted without looking closely"
Nice work!
"Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest & both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would‚Äôve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn‚Äôt mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing."
Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19

"Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses & other colds in general population is very high!"
"Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date & over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating & virus will exceed mass of known universe!"

"Recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. If this (land) landing fails, it will most likely be for a different reason."

"We‚Äôre stripping SN2 to bare minimum to test the thrust puck to dome weld under pressure, first with water, then at cryo. Hopefully, ready to test in a few days."
There‚Äôs a puck at the base that takes the engine thrust load. Don‚Äôt shuck the puck!

So  how was your night?
"Yes, dramatically improved imo"
"We need to finish work on Autopilot core foundation code & 3D labelling, then functionality will happen quickly. Not long now."

I just sent a note to Twitter to clarify that posting SpaceX videos is fine by us and we paid for rights to Bowie song for the Falcon Heavy launch
"The competitor should be a drone fighter plane that‚Äôs remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it."
It‚Äôs not that big really
Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design
It‚Äôs not mine
Definitely! What‚Äôs in that sky city thing!?  Needs a prequel even more than a sequel.

Getting there was super hard. Very proud of Tesla team!
Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing
"Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient & range, latter factoring in route elevation changes & cargo or tow mass & drag impact"
It‚Äôs slightly better
Definitely worth trying imo
"Btw, in some prior tweets I‚Äôd said production Cybertruck would be ~80‚Äù wide (vs ~84‚Äù body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82‚Äù, but come standard with upper laser blade lights."
Active ride height & active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Science has gone too far
üî≠
F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production & thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
"It‚Äôs mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light & back is heavy due to engines & landing legs."
"Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main."

These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full & rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
Probably
Attach wheels to the landing legs & tow Starship to the launch pad
I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
"High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks & fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done!"
"The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit"
"There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine."
"Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters."
"O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank"
In the order that they were written
Worth reading Asimov‚Äôs Foundation
"SN 2+ will have better fit & weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length."
The Persuader hammer will fix SN1

Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It‚Äôs stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice.
"Its integrated roof & solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"
Coming hopefully later this year
"I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice & snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!"
"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it‚Äôs very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."
Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust & weathering. This pic is brand new.

You‚Äôre welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
"Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter."
"No, they‚Äôre SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time."
"Yes, we‚Äôre tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering & building a heavy duty planisher to flatten & cold work the weld area"
"That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it‚Äôs built inside a factory in volume."
"This isn‚Äôt quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that‚Äôs 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures & welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."
"SpaceX started with a mariachi band party. Great vibes here in Boca Chica, Texas!"

"This is mainly for staffing up 4 production shifts for 24/7 operations, but engineers, supervisors & support personnel are certainly needed too. A super hardcore work ethic, talent for building things, common sense & trustworthiness are required, the rest we can train."
"Starship career day at the Stargate building (Boca Chica Blvd, TX) this Thursday from 3pm to 9pm!"

"First, we need to make it super safe & easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production & implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards."
"Ok sure üòÄ Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn‚Äôt be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory."
"Nothing medically dangerous, but 5g is getting a bit too greedy with their spectrum land grab"
"Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities I‚Äôm unaware of"
"True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature"
"It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don‚Äôt want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain & motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo."
Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. It‚Äôs *awesome*.

PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
"Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control & entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test."
"The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans & has severe drawbacks."
Sorry!
A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI & ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what‚Äôs truly hard). Don‚Äôt care if you even graduated high school.
"Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency"
Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
"We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto & Austin"
"Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data & efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory & ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later."
"Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable & optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets"
"Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors & compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with"
"‚ÄúAt Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isn‚Äôt just icing on the cake, it the cake‚Äù - @lexfridman 

Join AI at Tesla! It reports directly to me & we meet/email/text almost every day. My actions, not just words, show how critically I view (benign) AI."

Desperate times call for desperate measures
"Only 66 years from first controlled, powered flight to landing on the moon. Now, half a century later, we are still unable to return. This must change."

The safest place to hide a dead body is the second page of Google search results!
"Trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who aren‚Äôt being paid to push an agenda or scam. Google still shows bs/scam pages, they‚Äôre just several clicks away."
"This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things"
Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse & ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.

"Very true. What‚Äôs really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs & how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth‚Äôs surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun."
"Advancing humanity‚Äôs understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant üî≠ in orbit & on moon. With an occluder, could image üåè in other star systems."
One person‚Äôs MRI machine is another‚Äôs railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though.
"Exactly. We‚Äôve had good discussions with leading astronomers. One way or another, we‚Äôll make sure Starlink doesn‚Äôt inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky."

"Good analysis, although a bit conservative imo. However, using a high upper bound for land area that‚Äôs *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers. That giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun outputs a truly staggering amount of energy!"

Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank ‚Äî it‚Äôs just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don‚Äôt collapse when depressurized on the ground.
"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts & better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."

"Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said."
"The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."
"Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter & more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It‚Äôs like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!"
"Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn"

Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels & domes?
We‚Äôre focusing on Boca right now for Starship & Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
Spin start from COPVs so the ox & fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
"Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool."
"No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 & O2 from Raptor"
Yeah

"Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts & fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."

"They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It‚Äôs pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars."
"Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‚Äò93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed."
"Couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that‚Äôs me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol."
Maybe on Starship? It‚Äôs def got the payload capacity
Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
"Yeah, it‚Äôs one of my favorite T-shirts!"
"We‚Äôll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won‚Äôt do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck & almost died on one when I was 17."

There will be no loss of either
"That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width"
"True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages."
We can prob reduce width by an inch & maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything
"He‚Äôs def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs"

"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."

"Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
Pretty much
"Exactly! It‚Äôs also a far more exciting & inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
"No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous & difficult than Earth & take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That‚Äôs the sales pitch. Want to go?"
"So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
As the planets align only once every two years
A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs hard.
"Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
"If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles & each does 100 tons to orbit, that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
"Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it‚Äôs designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
Gas/diesel cars too

This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called ‚ÄúPitch Day‚Äù & I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don‚Äôt buy APCs. It‚Äôs the Air Force.
Fair point. Coming soon. We‚Äôre making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
"Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
More to come
Yes
Would be odd to expect anything else
"That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
"Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
Great poem
"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team & Airborne! To be clear, we‚Äôve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row."
"Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called ‚ÄúLow Gear‚Äù!"
"Tesla Solarglass vs üéÉ 
Happy Halloween!!"
"Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong"
"Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there‚Äôs a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 & 1/4 mile races."
Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!

Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I‚Äôm in awe.
"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It‚Äôs insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you"
"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I‚Äôve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
And the lead character is also named Woody
"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
Conservation of energy tells you the answer
Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
"We def could be wrong about this, but it‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place & only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don‚Äôt need a lot of room & moment of inertia is much lower."
"Also, we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table"
"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.
"This is true. All that matters is number used in ‚àÜv equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass."
"Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen & oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
"We‚Äôre working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren‚Äôt actual parking spaces."
"Yeah, great team!"
"To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth."

"When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many & much better than driving a single car."
Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that‚Äôs problematic above ~30 deg latitude.

"Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
"Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there‚Äôs a delay. Other countries are supportive."
"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1"
Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power & no more blackouts!

Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts.
All Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits.

"For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass & pressure."
"Current analysis, which I‚Äôm not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear & fwd fins during entry & landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward ‚Äúfin‚Äù would simply be used as a leg."

"Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on N√ºrburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range"
"No, but very close"
"Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys & Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago."
Absolutely
New Roadster and X will come later
"No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before."
It‚Äôs a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.

Wise words from Gary the Bot
"However, we won‚Äôt customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla & customer legal bill to be high & drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense."
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at  .
"Exactly! We‚Äôve only one car factory in California & one Gigafactory (for batteries & drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide."
"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
"That‚Äôs not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I‚Äôm looking into it"
"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
Agreed
"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
"There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
"Hopefully, next year"
"Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8"

"The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
"Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
Precisely
"Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you‚Äôll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you‚Äôre prob ok."

"Everything happens so fast. It‚Äôs such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins."
"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell & fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that‚Äôs not indicative of capability."
"Over time, 355 & 385 are possible, but very difficult"
Most likely

"True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids & a mass driver, but this is risky."
"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
"Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins & landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
"Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth & gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming"

Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites üõ∞ to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
"AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It‚Äôs mostly design-review based, not flight-based."
"Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters"

"With the new lower Tesla pricing, it‚Äôs like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious."
Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think
Which means a small corner of Texas  (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire United States
1 Gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches Earth‚Äôs surface
In a few years
"Yeah, legs are hydraulic pistons & abdomen is the accumulator"
Generates a *lot* of energy
It is quite silly
Meaning less than a century. But this would be pretty intense.
"Aspirationally, decades"
The sun is an immense thermonuclear explosion fyi
Yes
"Not saying it solves everything, mind you, but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction"
"Yeah, the trick is opening & closing the spacesuit helmet really fast"

Perhaps that one was too edgy
Hashtags are an abomination
"No, as better to vary thickness with vehicle height, but this is the right way to go for Boring Co tunnels reinforcement imo"

"Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B"
"Powerwall doesn‚Äôt need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla & non-Tesla solar panels"
Yes
Between $100B and $10T
Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
For sure
Yup
Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
Gas cars are so last-century!
Priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with FSD
"We‚Äôre accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!"
"Probably every 2 to 4 months, depending on how much progress we make"
Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke!
FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue

Probably
Agreed. That‚Äôs approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can‚Äôt make enough of them & we won‚Äôt be able to."
"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"

"Yeah, that‚Äôs next after summon"
"Will trace back inertial measurements & wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off"
"Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year"
Probably 5mph or 8 km/h

Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
"Agreed, it‚Äôs a small, but important, feature"
Ok

"Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs"
Take note
"About right, but dangerously chuggy & risking bad things at 40%. We‚Äôll keep it above 50% for this flight."
"More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin Œ∏/2, as I recall, but doesn‚Äôt matter, as there‚Äôs no geo üõ∞ anywhere near that mass."

"End of Q4, most likely"
"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won‚Äôt diverge until Q4, as it‚Äôs limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
This is why it‚Äôs possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k & make at least ~500k FSD cars
All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer & all production in past few months has FSD computer

Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesn‚Äôt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
You‚Äôre touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We‚Äôre fixing that with Starship.

"~1000, as all seats would be ‚Äúcoach‚Äù & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It‚Äôs basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
"About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher & stability of booster in ground winds is low"
There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.

"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock & strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals & bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

Haha
Depends on destination
"Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level"

Gary the üêå still crushes us! Wouldn‚Äôt be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
This is simple and just works

Can‚Äôt think of anything
Someone else thought of an electric üçÅüçÉüçÇ blower first? What!?
Tesla blows haha
We can probably just repurpose Model 3 HVAC parts. Not a big deal.
True
Long lasting battery + fast recharge > pack swap
Haha ok
"It‚Äôs been suggested by many, externally & internally"
Aren‚Äôt there good ones already?
Maybe add a particulate filter on inlet
"Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower"
"Yeah, there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed, Fred. Hello."
Will do
Absolutely
Seriously
"Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez"
"Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV‚Äôs have high fire risk when opposite is true."
"Thanks, support super appreciated"
Sad if true üòî
"When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there‚Äôs a good reason that isn‚Äôt obvious."

"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
"Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year & thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
"Those who predicted Tesla & EVs would be dead & autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars & autonomy was between 10 years & never
Anti-matter def wins on energy density ü§£ü§£
"Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) & we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year."
"As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost & larger range pack needed."
Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone
Anyone who did this analysis should interview at Tesla
Upgrading hardware is not important for a few months
Is that a real billboard?
We‚Äôll let the NN loose on Track Mode one day  that‚Äôll be insane
Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark
Or maybe pegging
"On yeah, that too"
"Exactly. Also, you can‚Äôt actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds."

Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won‚Äôt spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.

Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.
Starhopper just lifted off & hit tether limits!
Max thrust of 2550 tons will be almost 10% higher than Falcon Heavy demo mission last year
"Static fire data looks good so far. This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block 5, so we‚Äôre being extra cautious. Launch date might move."
Exactly
"‚Äúdrivers in this dataset use Autopilot for 34.8% of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance.‚Äù"
Hi Nina! So  how many ¬£ would it take? Just between us.

"Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars"
That‚Äôs exactly the idea. What‚Äôs not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software & going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22.

Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
Impressive analysis
"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we‚Äôll add a setting to disable internal camera."
"Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows & rear window."
"It‚Äôs there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."
Will take care of it
Improvements coming soon

Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!
This is way more awesome than it might sound
Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower & allow below current ‚Äú0%‚Äù level. Making that adjustment too.
Agreed
Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.

"In retrospect, lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday."
"However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak"
"We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team & board."
"When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write Tesla a check. So it goes."
Yes
Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too

"Very dependent on volume, but I‚Äôm confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k & maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth & move to Mars if they want."
Yes
"This will sound implausible, but I think there‚Äôs a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
Close
"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."

"Rocket booster temperatures won‚Äôt go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads

Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
"Design requires at least 170 metric tons of force. Engine reached 172 mT & 257 bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means 10% to 20% more with deep cryo."
Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship & Super Heavy
"Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow."
We‚Äôre doing everything we can to get there. It‚Äôs a super hard grind.
"Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other & lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, it‚Äôs way better."
VAT of ~20% & import duties of ~10% usually result in a 30% higher cost in Europe

"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher & doesn‚Äôt even need paint!"
Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
Mostly true
"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps & main engines for landing orientation, so won‚Äôt need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
Yes
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship & booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) & sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas
Yes. It‚Äôs very rare to find all three.
"To be clear, I‚Äôm confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature & reduced need for heat shielding"
"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime & angle of attack"
Absolutely. You‚Äôve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar
"About 10 orbit synch windows, which are every 26 months, so self-sufficiency around 2050"

No need to wait. It‚Äôs super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
Thanks!
The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats & just wipe it off.

You‚Äôre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.

Interesting
"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
The new design is metal
"As far as we know, it‚Äôs the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn‚Äôt need heat shielding or even paint."
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump & lines."
We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."

Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes

"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.

"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for ‚Äúgrant money‚Äù. They earn ü•ú vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
"That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
"We know we‚Äôll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far"

"Good, but not hospital grade. S & X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid & alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."
"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S & X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."

Around mid 2019
"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit & finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn‚Äôt look like a radiator grill opening.
"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there‚Äôs no such thing as a Tesla ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S & X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."
"Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"

Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year

I believe it‚Äôs $5k
~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."
"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
Still a long way to go

~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."
"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
Still a long way to go
Model 3 motor & gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
Works best if you play games full screen & use steering wheel scroller balls for control

About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth & half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens & we destroy ourselves
You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Don‚Äôt have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.

"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative ‚Äî it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds & small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."

"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors & retirement funds, don‚Äôt realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base & gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
I hope to be less wrong over time

Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia & other important car terms at

"At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam"
Did you investigate at all? I‚Äôm guessing answer is no. Why?
"It‚Äôs coming, I swear"
You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs strange he hasn‚Äôt sued me? He was offered free legal services. And you call yourself @yoda

Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn‚Äôt needed just for enhanced Autopilot.

Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)"
No change
Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private
Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we‚Äôre private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity‚Äôs SpaceX investment.
Yes
I don‚Äôt have a controlling vote now & wouldn‚Äôt expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won‚Äôt be selling in either scenario.

"Yes, Tesla Model S, X & 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked"
Ok
"Makes me very sad indeed, but also the fault is mine by far"

I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.
Don‚Äôt make me bite my thumb at you
For sure
"Btw, 1792 is calling & wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime & save lives of many birds."
No kidding
"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
"Phew üòÖ. Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago & people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
"Figuratively, literally or both?"
That has always been our goal
"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. ‚ÄúOther US‚Äù refers to Boeing & Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts & subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders."

Definitely. We gave up some grip & width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires & wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims & tires.
"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"

"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."
"As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader."
Good point
I have never donated to a SuperPAC
"Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I don‚Äôt understand why they are not important to everyone."
Actually true
Hold up a mirror & see if it fogs
"I‚Äôm honored to work with an amazing group of people at Tesla, but always happy to talk to an ace who might want to join"
Safe to lick. I checked.

"Look, at least it‚Äôs not the Magellanic Clouds. They‚Äôre basically next door."
"Just between us, I have a teleportation stargate to the Andromeda galaxy. It‚Äôs amazing."
So true
The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued & water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
Sounds good
Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
It will happen for sure. Damn.
Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn‚Äôt. Wonder why.

Yeah
Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.

Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm & ppb test results & will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I‚Äôm in China so that won‚Äôt be working until tomorrow."
Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.

"Definitely. Can‚Äôt wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
Well  it looked smaller on paper
"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big"
"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump & generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
Makes a lot of sense
This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it‚Äôs there for anyone who needs it in future. Something‚Äôs messed up if this is not a good thing.
I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
Please lmk results of your water tests
"When you‚Äôre there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
Should be very soon. We‚Äôve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
Exactly
"No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers & supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"

"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry & at std air pressure entire time."
"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review & discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey & demonstrate at any time."

Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
Ok
Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts & named Wild Boar after kids‚Äô soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
That would be cool. I wonder what it‚Äôs like under all that ice.
A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
"Thanks, but we‚Äôve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
Tube diameter is 31cm

I‚Äôm in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."

"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
Good idea
"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."

It‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
I would def recommend this
Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
Interesting
"Great, thanks"
Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won‚Äôt come in"
"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.

Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was ‚Äúdancing her face off‚Äù with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
It‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
I would def recommend this
Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
Interesting
"Great, thanks"
Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won‚Äôt come in"
"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
"I know you & believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"

Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was ‚Äúdancing her face off‚Äù with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos‚Äôs cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
.@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos & Tepper with caption ‚ÄúLove both these dudes‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt sound very objective
"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette & supports everything she‚Äôs done? Why won‚Äôt Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
True
"So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla‚Äôs most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is ‚Äúone of the greatest.‚Äù Her articles print Chanos‚Äôs view verbatim. This is not journalism."
".@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you ‚Äúsee eye to eye‚Äù with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
What a coincidence
Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst‚Äôs prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
"Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
"Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings & extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst‚Äôs track record before hearing their opinion."
"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
"Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you‚Äôre  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla‚Äôs biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him & he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
"has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &3 production number, which is physically impossible."
"Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production & followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 & @Reuters."
".@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
".@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

"Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high."
Try saying ‚Äúbug report‚Äù. Might work better. Ironic if the bug report about bug reports isn‚Äôt working :)
"Thanks for the feedback, will investigate"
Sure
Congratulations!
It‚Äôs actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people & good for environment. I think that‚Äôs fundamental goodness.

Thanks for coming by our car factory with @westcoastbill. Tesla team was super fired up to see you! Congrats on your victory!!
"Crazy, that was over 22 years ago. Thanks for believing in us!"
"There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That‚Äôs still ~40 people."
Today. It‚Äôs kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn‚Äôt change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.

"He‚Äôs obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak & a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."
Great name. A little on the nose.
"That‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is."
"Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced & above 50% too negatively affects economic output."

Yup
"That‚Äôs ridiculous, lions can‚Äôt vote, they don‚Äôt even have opposable thumbs. Also, they‚Äôd need 61%, so no."

I think so
I hope the kids are ok

You‚Äôre probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down.
I‚Äôm at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. It‚Äôs big.
They look beautiful
Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
It‚Äôs actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable & a great view of the mountains.
Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga & spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
They also poured the concrete & built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it‚Äôs way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
No

Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I‚Äôm driving.
Can‚Äôt wait for the new @RickandMorty season to start!
"We‚Äôve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union & Tesla stock. Also, free drinks & snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla & me via 3rd parties."
Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
"Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show."
"I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) & other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America."
They started it & attacked me personally
Search UAW and ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù. Very long reading list. Great organization.
‚ÄúProfit‚Äù just means you earned more money than you spent & certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing & extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years & we‚Äôre almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford & Tesla has gone bankrupt.
They don‚Äôt seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
Engels wrote 2nd & 3rd volumes based on Marx‚Äôs ‚Äúnotes‚Äù. Less reliable.
"Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware."

You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That‚Äôs a very bigoted position.
Well said
Then you‚Äôll be fine
Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
"...which clearly doesn‚Äôt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they‚Äôre getting desperate."
"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
How big is your short position? Just curious.
Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
"UAW doesn‚Äôt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they‚Äôre getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps."
"I‚Äôm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too."
"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
"Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."

"SX 300 & soon SX 500. Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine."

The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape & size of those streams.
Strongly disagree. I love humanity.
"Already did. Meant to go longer, but ran out of time."
I always wanted to do a terms & conditions cover of Green Eggs & Ham
Foundation Series & Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX
I love Banks. Best books in recent years imo are Iain Banks & George Martin.
"Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon"
Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. It‚Äôs pretty simple & mostly influenced by Douglas Adams & Isaac Asimov.
My donations are anonymous
Already sold >$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about 20 years when Tesla is steady state.

"Yes, interface will change with Version 9 software"
"Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean ‚Äúslight up or downward force on the wheel‚Äù, not really ‚Äúhold the wheel‚Äù"

"Of course, but it‚Äôs the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet & anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing & we‚Äôre never going to make them again."
"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It‚Äôs what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust ‚Äî literally bulletproof."
Not recommended for urban environments
Yes
"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I‚Äôm thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.

"Sigh. This is crux of matter: can‚Äôt make system too annoying or people won‚Äôt use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can‚Äôt allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
"Yes. Hopefully, I‚Äôm not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
Will do
"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there‚Äôs no escaping Newton‚Äôs Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) & O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be another."
"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the ‚Äúhalo crown‚Äù effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."

"Of course, but it‚Äôs the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet & anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing & we‚Äôre never going to make them again."
"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It‚Äôs what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust ‚Äî literally bulletproof."
Not recommended for urban environments
Yes
"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I‚Äôm thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
Love this design. Simpler the better.
Add an R for Roadster üëΩüíïüöÄ
"Sigh. This is crux of matter: can‚Äôt make system too annoying or people won‚Äôt use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can‚Äôt allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
"Yes. Hopefully, I‚Äôm not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
Will do
"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there‚Äôs no escaping Newton‚Äôs Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) & O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be another."
"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the ‚Äúhalo crown‚Äù effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
"This is why I‚Äôm not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I‚Äôd know everything‚Äôs fine & no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh ü§î"

Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter"
And we‚Äôre definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form"
Running track in @SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this
"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S & X w HW2 Autopilot & all Model 3 cars."
Working on improving
"No way 6 mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, 7 mins is obv right."
"Oh please, that‚Äôs obv overkill"
Tip of the day
Coming soon
"We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though, not 2 years."
Congratulations @murraymatt. Good move by @WSJ. Please use Matt‚Äôs Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor

"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
"Yup, deleted"

"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking & will ride tire traction limit. You won‚Äôt notice sport brakes unless you‚Äôre on a racetrack & have the sticky 20‚Äù tires."
"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks @ConsumerReports for excellent critical feedback!"
"Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers & sport level brakes"

All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
Model 3 was designed for min engineering & tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe & Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.

Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
That‚Äôs why editors are included too
We don‚Äôt. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
"Even if some of the public doesn‚Äôt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join

"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world‚Äôs biggest advertisers."
The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he‚Äôs above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
"Thought you‚Äôd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like Trump!‚Äù Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."

Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today‚Äôs Model S is far more refined than initial production."
ABS calibration algorithm
"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won‚Äôt stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
"Stop, you‚Äôre making me blush ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
Complexity is the devil. Words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we‚Äôll try.
"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3‚Äôs have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we‚Äôve seen anything like this."
"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3‚Äôs having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
Gwynne‚Äôs awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.

"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
I didn‚Äôt meet with him
I definitely don‚Äôt do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can‚Äôt be creative otherwise.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today‚Äôs Model S is far more refined than initial production."
ABS calibration algorithm
"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won‚Äôt stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
"Stop, you‚Äôre making me blush ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
Complexity is the devil. Words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we‚Äôll try.
"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."

Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù by Reveal."
We‚Äôre working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak & pinpoint origin by acoustic signature & triangulation
SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to @NASA Plum Brook vacuum chamber
For sure before snowfall this year
It can tow far more than rated capacity
Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
Exactly üöÄüí´üéâ! That will be really fun & shed light on what‚Äôs happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
"Yeah, ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today‚Äôs non-union."
"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
Yes
Exactly
They can form a union whenever they want & there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don‚Äôt want to.
Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It‚Äôs like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
"They are correct. It‚Äôs awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can‚Äôt tell"
Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."

Good idea ...
That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
"It‚Äôs only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
I‚Äôm about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20‚Äù Performance wheels, black & white interior."
"AC induction front & switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output & get double the burn-in."
Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive & performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
Check out  . Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
But The Boring Company is right behind you at 1/15th your speed & soon will be 1/10th! Start sweating
He taunts us with his speed

Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever
Excited for @boringcompany partnership with LA Metro
lol
Listening to REALiTi
"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
Yes
Will be presenting & taking questions  about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at 7pm on Thursday
Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground & ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins
"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
"It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
Yes
"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
Happy Mother‚Äôs Day Mom! Love you so much.
"Fair criticism, but we‚Äôre fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
