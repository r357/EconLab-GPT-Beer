Turns out you can make anything fly haha
Exactly. This is not fully appreciated.
"Starship SN6 flew asimilar hop to SN5, but it was a much smoother & faster operation"

"Over time, outer 20 will have ~300 tons of thrust & inner 8 ~210, so roughly 7500 tons total at sea level or 1.5 T/W for booster+ship"
Yeah
Just go through resonant modes fast. It’s when you hang out there that problems arise.
"The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC & differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever."
Videodrome

"Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind."
"Yeah, he sent it to me through a mutual physics prof friend at Caltech/CERN. Very basic stuff."
It’s too embarrassing
Just learned that my physics prof from Penn is head of Fermilab & still has some of my old homework ☺️
"It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas & underweight bringing them to fruition. For example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard."
"People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions & a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect."
That & Giga Berlin are why I’m headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines & cures in many areas.
"Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low & symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells"
Yeah
"One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife & Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was."
"Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn’t blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval."

Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.
"People read too much into this level of detail. It’s not useful for predicting the future, nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term, fine-grained level."
Critical feedback is always appreciated btw
"We can’t have a blanket pass, but maybe for some events"
"Booster design has shifted to four legs with a wider stance (to avoid engine plume impingement in vacuum), rather than six"
Later versions of a larger device would have that potential
Yup
"Actually C, although the syntax could be improved esthetically"
"I like C, because it avoids class warfare"
A nightcap would probably work best

"Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust."

They’re quite accurate!
That number sure comes up a lot 🤣🤣
I’m fine with reasonable drone footage. Just needs to be at a fair distance & not coming right up to people. I think our security was a little overzealous in this case.
Thanks to a smart and hardworking team at Tesla. These sure are wild times

"Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day."
"Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That’s probably faster."
Now I want candy
There’s a lot of frozen CO2 & H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. It’s solvable.
Perhaps one day there will be an ocean on the northern part of Mars
It’s almost working reliably
"Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don’t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately."
Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory & super high bandwidth between cores & efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
No & not possible at this scale
Orbital launch mount
"Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise."

"That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease."

"Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine."
"Mostly for employees, but we’ll support public access whenever it’s safe & secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary."
Absolutely 😃 🏝
"I don’t want be cavalier, but there isn’t an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine."
"I’ve been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat & humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though."
Dojo V1.0 isn’t done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power & cooling problem is hard.

"It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant & pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers & stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!"

"Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons & min is ~90 tons, so they’re actually quite similar. Both Merlin & Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner & Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound."
💨
That’s engine SN. We’re building SN8 of the ship.
"SN40 is about to be tested & has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force."

"Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We’ll do lots of flights."
"Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger & there’ll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing."
This might sting a little

"The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point."
Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production
SN8
Impressive
Psyche
"Yes, integrated with the tip of the nose"
This is important
Probably not faster than utility power can be restored. Powerwall/Powerpack/Megapack can certainly be helpful long-term.
Starship fairing will actually have more height than shown here. Dome will be flatter & more of tip is accessible. Usable volume ~1000 cubic meters.
You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.
So why is this madness acceptable for Boeing/Lockheed rockets?
Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once & then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd
I generally try my best not to be on patents
"Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary & “space power”. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money."
"Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails."

Sorry to hear this. What can we do to help?
No surprise
Aiming to make it super fun!
A little toastier each flight
"Same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion & body bending."
SN7 will be new alloy test tank taken to burst pressure. SN8 will have body flaps & nosecone.
SN 5 & 6 at Starship Production Complex in Texas
"One day soon, I will wear this outfit"
I was trying to channel Herb Tarlek from WKRP
Note the fabulous plaid jacket & gingham shirt combo 🤣
Twin Peaks
Working on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan at age 17. I think we did a barn-raising that day.
"Not sure yet, but hopefully. Will need leg & other repairs. Probably SN6 flies before SN5. We need to make flights simple & easy — many per day."
Clearly
Also true
🤣🤣
"Over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round, where I owned ~60% of Tesla to today at ~20%, it has declined by a factor of 3."
I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed
"And why aim your attacks at Tesla, when we’re doing more than any other company on Earth to advance green/sustainable energy? Have you read the news?"

That bs was pushed by oil & gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. Bernard Sanders is a docile puppet of big oil!
🎯
"Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies."
💯
"Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short"
"Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height."
I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
It will look crazy tall with booster & fairing at 122m / 394 ft
Ok
"Apart from failing to quarantine elderly/at-risk people early (a mistake they recognize), they were right"
Good piece on Giga Berlin construction
This seems increasingly likely
This is gonna be great
SN5
"We’ll do several short hops to smooth out launch process, then go high altitude with body flaps"
Soon
"V1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider & taller — like Falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces & auto-leveling."
Progress is accelerating

True
Highly likely down the road
True fact
"Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didn’t open, triggering an automatic abort. We’ll figure out why & retry tomorrow."
I’m in the Boca control room. Hop attempt in ~33 minutes.
For sure
"Tbh, I must confess to occasionally pontificating about high-concept things"
Pretty much

"However, we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover"
"All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes."
Great game
Working on it
The simplest solution is not necessarily the most satisfying

Absolutely. Long-lasting art is incredibly difficult.

Starship SN5 just completed full duration static fire. 150m hop soon.
🖤🧛‍♀️Total Eclipse of the Heart 🧛‍♀️🖤
😮
Not that I’m aware of
Yes. Could also extend range of hearing beyond normal frequencies and amplitudes. Deus Ex.
"Neuralinks are currently meant for mature brains & functionality is lost if removed. Rewiring of neurons is certainly possible, but won’t make up for loss of the Link."
"Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups & restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device."
Will show neurons firing in real-time on August 28th. The matrix in the matrix.
They don’t fire all at once. Some go several seconds to minutes without firing. Some fire several times per second. Very wide timing distribution.
Congrats on a great launch!
But sometimes when we touch
Adagio for Strings is great
Losing It
🤣🤣
Mein Herz Brennt. Best boss battle song ever.
Robot Heart is 🔥🔥
One of the all time best
Sure

I  I just died in your arms tonight
The rumor that Bill Gates & I are lovers is completely untrue
Yeah. Display will also soon render Teslas specifically as their model & color instead of as a generic sedan/SUV. Has potential for a fun punch buggy sort of game.
"We’ve been working on this for about 4 years. Originally meant for rabies vaccine, but it can make pretty much anything that’s an RNA sequence. Critical path is completing human trials."
🎶 Billy G is not my lover 🎶
Sounds like he doesn’t realize Tesla makes the vaccine machine for CureVac
Thanks for letting me know. Will dig into it.
😉
Sum > parts
"Should add a few miles of range, more in slow traffic"
The government has the most money by far. They talk in trillions.
Haha no one can ever have our top secret fart technology!!
💕 💕
Sure
"Tesla is open to licensing software and supplying powertrains & batteries. We’re just trying to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors!"
What he doesn’t appear to appreciate is that government is just a monopolist corporation in the limit

He was amazing
Great song
"Nickel is the biggest challenge for high-volume, long-range batteries! Australia & Canada are doing pretty well. US nickel production is objectively very lame. Indonesia 🇮🇩 is great!"
🤣🤣
That’s me! Haha
This has a lot of potential. Lithium is pretty much everywhere.
Whoa cool
🤣🤣
Has to be blue steel :)
"We need high Brinell hardness & high corrosion resistance. Because of Cybertruck’s faceted nature, formability is not important."
I really want to do this! Will be great fun. Could be both LA and Austin.
Turning them into shade for an outdoor restaurant here in Boca

"Some contribute more. Y chromosome & mitochondria are constant, except for mutations."
Yes
"That is just one part of the surgery. For this to scale, it must be fully automated, like LASIK."
This would solve a lot of brain/spine injuries & is ultimately essential for AI symbiosis
Fermi was awesome. He understood the right questions to ask.

No prior neuroscience background is required. This is primarily an electrical/electronic (chip design)/mechanical/software engineering problem for the Link itself & the surgical robot.

"This thing we call “money” is just a (slow, lossy & unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people, at least until AGI happens, which will obviate need for labor & necessitate UBI."
Trying to set a good example haha. Mars needs people!
Great work by Tesla software engineering
Population collapse is 2nd biggest danger to civilization after AI imo
"Yeah, will take less than a minute to order on   when it goes live"
"Starlink terminal has motors to self-orient for optimal view angle. No expert installer required. Just plug in & give it a clear view of the sky. Can be in garden, on roof, table, pretty much anywhere, so long as it has a wide view of the sky."
Ok
🤔
"To revolutionize space, the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to # of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale don’t lie."
Exactly
"Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation. Also, what about Autobahn!?"
"The strength & perseverance of the people of Tesla, despite facing extreme difficulties"
Playable on any Tesla!
Should do this automatically
"Mass to orbit is a more accurate metric than # of launches, although should be orbit-adjusted (eg GTO>LEO), which would increase competitor mass numbers"
Cute
Wow
Reusability is essential. A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane. F9 engines already fire 3 times per flight.

"Doing range testing now. Number will be significantly higher than 300. Extremely good for any EV, especially an SUV."
"We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor & will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent"
Yes
It may be able to reach 250kW at low states of charge
"No, as range would be unacceptably low (< 250 mile EPA)"
"We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S/X to reduce resistive heating. Technically, won’t be quite 1000 mph charging, as X especially is much bigger than 3."
Hell of a ride!
Thanks :)
That is the near-term danger of AI

This bill needs to be revoked. It gives absurd power to county bureaucrats.
"If accurate, this would explain a lot"
Levitt is right
"There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none."
Very much agree
Good hygiene always makes sense
True
Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
"There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations & mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest."

"If accurate, this would explain a lot"
Levitt is right
"There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none."
Very much agree
Good hygiene always makes sense
True
Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
"There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations & mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest."
"Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla."
Great Model Y review by @jayleno

69 days after 4/20 again haha
"Physics favors electric transport, batteries for stationary storage & solar/wind for energy generation"
Major Supercharger increases are underway for the greater LA area
For sure
"Verified should be far more widespread, simply that someone is who they claim to be"
It’s a tough one. That’s why we should expand the scope & scale of consciousness — to understand the nature of the Universe.
Jay is awesome
Absolutely!
Giga Berlin is gonna rock!
.@JeffBezos is a copy 🐈 haha
It’s close though 😅
"This makes no sense for many other reasons too. They don’t actually have spectrum priority, they have shared spectrum & nothing about this company is UK, except post office box. Money would be better spent on actual UK satellite industry!"
Glad you like it!
Great idea

North American Supercharger usage tracking to exceed pre covid highs in 2 to 3 weeks. Lot of noise out there. This is signal.
I think we could make that work
Glad you’re ok
"Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality & market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion, we need to convert >80% of the global road, sea & air fleet to renewables by 2050."
Looks pretty cool
Could be slightly faster
Two Starship tanks in the midbay
Ok
Special thanks to Tesla trucking & rail partners for figuratively & literally going the extra mile
Apologies to Tesla customers for shifting delivery dates. It’s a crazy world out there!
"Yes, it is designed to serve the least-served"
"Yes, although Starlink works best for low population density situations"
Canada is a major priority for Starlink!
September sounds about right
Well said by @Kurz_Gesagt
"Takes longer to get regulatory approvals in Europe, plus way more diverse traffic signs, lights & road rules"
"Timing is uncertain, given externalities, but yes"
Congratulations!
"Very much disagree with this action. In my experience, these skillsets are net job creators. Visa reform makes sense, but this is too broad."
Will be changed to $3k until July 1st

Tentative date for Tesla Shareholder Meeting & Battery Day is Sept 15. Will include tour of cell production system.
Done. Now $2k via in-app purchase.
Reminder that Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) price goes up by $1k on July 1st
Enabling basic Tesla Autopilot via Tesla in-app purchase is reduced to $2k until July 1
All patched up!

"There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD"
"This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?"
This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
"Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure."
Haha Teslas all the way down

Feels so long ago
Pulling up to The Petersen
Nice
We will add one more PTO day after the annual review next quarter
It will look a little odd
Probably Fremont
"Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. I’m hopeful we can announce a date after the July 4th week."
"Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July 7th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later."
Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars & bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.
"It does require use of a paid-time-off day, which is true of many other holidays"

"Tesla has an option to purchase this land, but has not exercised it"
Renewable energy is happening fast
Comes standard with Cybertruck
Not sure. They’re pretty close together.
It will be real
Maybe Incat
There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.
We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch & landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.
"Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system & doesn’t come back & land"
"US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology"
Pretty much
Illuminaughty haha
"SpaceX is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for Mars, moon & hypersonic travel around Earth"
Maybe some Flextape
"No problem, we can buff it out"
Fairing reuse is looking good
So where are the aliens?
Or Y
No larger pack Model 3 is in development
"Actually, we’ve made slight changes, but the range improvement is >90% efficiency"

All Model S cars made since late Jan have 402 mile range. This is just making it official.
Tesla Model S now first ever electric vehicle to receive EPA range rating above 400 miles!
Absolutely
China & Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind.
Looking likely
"Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out."
"Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result & supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
"Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed."
Yes
"That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points."
Accurate
Sure
"Around 20ms. It’s designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency."
It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in & point at sky. Can be done in either order.
Congratulations Kathy!

Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers & improving fast
"Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2."
"We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights."

Haha. Will post summary.
"Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 & O2 liquid at similar temps) & higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage"

We’re working on new legs. Wider stance & able to auto-level. Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky & pitted surfaces.
"Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha."
Absolutely
"Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results & latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible."
"Wow, this is extremely important!!"

Starship is the key to making life multiplanetary & protecting the light of consciousness
Well said
Definitely not right that the other officers were charged with nothing. What message does this send in general to officers who stand by while another does wrong? #JusticeForGeorge

"Proceeding with countdown today, weather cancellation risk ~50%"
Yes
"Worth noting that, as of Jan 1, Tesla buyers no longer received any federal tax credit. Model 3 led despite this disadvantage."
"We slowed down a bit to allow Supercharger V3 production to get going, but now will speed up!"

"His ideas sound sensible, but he was not my or SpaceX’s “brain coach”. I think he maybe gave a talk once."
5 years ago. We need to accelerate progress towards fully reusable rockets. Cost per ton to orbit needs to improve by >1000% from where Falcon is today for there to be a self-sustaining city on Mars.
Mars needs to happen soon
Made on Earth by humans
Cool
Pretty much
"Reviewed design with Franz last night. Even 3% smaller is too small. Will be pretty much this size. We’ll probably do a smaller, tight world truck at some point."
Haha true! Hard to convey tone in tweets. Many people would probably be a lot less upset if they heard me speak the words.

"Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county."
"San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible & reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational & detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada."
"Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA."
"Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected & ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!"
"No, I have a license!"

"No, but it’s mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)"
"It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal."
"To be clear, I do think finance & law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs."
"Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)"
Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
"Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg."

Probably makes sense to have a “Details” section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.

"A fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc."
SLS makes me feel sad
"No, they will be smashed beyond repair & corroded"
"Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine"
A great mystery of the universe
It’s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
"Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!"
"Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars & maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life."
"In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid"
"Yes, converts CO2 & H2O to CH4 & O2. Perfect for Mars!"
"Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we’ll be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack."
Turns on city street intersections is the big one
Yes. Static fire feeding from fuel header vs main tank.
Not SpaceX
His son sounds great btw
2008 was a super tough year on all levels
"Tesla & SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That’s why."

"It’s true, the pressure bulkheads are too pointy"
Starship SN4 passed static fire
"Happy, healthy & cute as a button :)"
This person is wrong. Why does JD want to believe he got cucked so bad anyway!?
There would be time-stamped video if this were true
Should be a lot of fun!
Yes
That was the whole company back then. Grew organically from a simple mariachi party in El Segundo.
U r a powerful 🧚‍♀️👸
Wishing good vibes for all in 2nd half 2020
"I mean, this does seem like a time for Dad jokes  🤣🤣"
Orange you glad it’s not entomology?
"Yeah, but stopped doing physically risky things after the kids were born"
Archangel-12

Not to mention  !
Thanks Maria 💕
Possibly even flatter!

There are many pieces to the puzzle
DKE in a nutshell: we’re almost always dumber than we think we are
"Science is simply rigorous pursuit of truth. Quality of reasoning is all that matters, which means a ten-year-old could be more correct than a physics Nobel Prize winner."
That would be awesome
"This is false. JD’s team put out “video evidence”, but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD & AH had separated."
"Yeah, definitely a future feature"
Levitt rocks
"Important to distinguish died with covid vs died because of covid. Also, distinguish between tested positive for covid or only had symptoms."
Utter moron
Thanks! Something more should be done. This guy has caused massive strife to the world with his absurdly fake “science”.
What a tool
Nope. Thanks!
Thanks :) Never too young for some ink haha
Boy
X Æ A-12 Musk
Mom & baby all good
A few hours away!
"Anyway, we’re just talking about 2% here, so not much. Confident Model S will get 400+ miles as soon as retest is allowed."

Weird that EPA would deny this. We have precise car logs that confirm it happened. Happy to provide them.
I hope anything lands
It seems unlikely right now
Mostly accurate. Liquid CH4 temp got too high this time. Offloading propellant. Will we retry later today.
Thanks!
Commentary is quite entertaining! MST3K
SN4 🔥 soon. Raptor looks so smōl.
Good chance it accelerates viral vaccines & cures
True 🤣🤣
What’s troubling is that this doesn’t get humanity a base on the moon or even a small crewed Mars mission
"Excuse me, that’s Mr. Bizznizz 🧲. Where’s the respek!? 🤣🤣"
There are many silver linings & that is one

"A little. Will have 31 engines, not 37, no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at 200 ton, but upgrades in the works for 250 ton."
Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokémon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?
Minecraft has amazing legs
That was 2.5 years ago & still not even on the moon. Progress must accelerate!
Pretty much
What excites you about 2030?
I don’t want to set the world on fire by the Ink Spots
One of the all-time best songs

We’re going to try landing Starship on the moon with enough propellant to return to Earth

Baby due on Monday
Don’t need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession just weigh you down.
My gf @Grimezsz is mad at me
Just one stipulation on sale: I own Gene Wilder’s old house. It cannot be torn down or lose any its soul.
"Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness"
Exactly. How cheaply freedom is sold.
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
"Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave"
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
"And the rocket's red glare, 
the bombs bursting in air"
Now give people back their FREEDOM

Too much the moral arbiter of the world
Silicon Valley has become Sanctimonious Valley
Starship will be able to launch telescopes over 3X diameter of Hubble
Hopefully start serving Africa early next year

Oddly mesmerizing
"Haha true. Great headline. It’s quite hard to have rocket test articles not explode, as they so desperately want to!"
Interesting
Yes
Just one. SN5 will get three.
Static fire with Raptor hopefully later this week
"4.9 bar. Kind of a softball tbh, but that’s enough to fly!"
Great work by SpaceX engineering!
SN4 passed cryo proof! 😅
What do you make of the FT claims?
"FT is saying current death rate is extremely unusual, but you’re saying 2017 was higher. Which is correct?"
Snowing in Texas
Cryo test underway
Dark mode makes Twitter feel like night
How is it considered probable if there’s no covid test? Is just a cough or high temperature enough?
So dark out there
Would be helpful to distinguish deaths caused by covid vs unrelated to covid!
True

Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
Docs make good points
"Yes, switching soon to a 300 series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp. 301 is good as sheet, but not as plate. Also, a lot of geometric changes."
Not yet
Successive iteration of both design & manufacturing. Latter is 1000% harder than former.
It’s a little dicey tbh. Thrust dome is being redesigned. Current one has four separate layers of steel in some places!
150m
Physically ready in a few weeks. Approvals may take longer.
Aiming for cryo pressure test tonight
SN4 passed ambient pressure test
Romance Mode 🔥
Dogecoin Mode
Great
👍 🤣
Heard same from doc I trust
"No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad"
That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
So often true 🤣🤣
Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time & reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
These won’t be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.

Great labeling tools & talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools & infrastructure is underrated.
"As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is >1000% harder than designing it"
It’s also because of the Spitfire engine & wizard
Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
Progress is good
Definitely
Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame & actuation.
"Sure, we can probably do an update later this year"
Needs to be more than halfway to east coast
"Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity"
Yes
Yes
I agree
Mythic Quest is 🤣🤣 MTTD
Mean Time To Dick is a key measure of any given human or machine intelligence system
Merlin is very simple compared to Raptor
Width currently limited by size of cold-roll press needed to get steel to full hard condition. Bigger press will be built long-term.
Absolutely
Great questions from Hack Club!
That’s hardcore

Starship SN4 tank on test stand
"Yes, same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities & mortality proportionate to age."
Silver lining is that mortality rate is much lower than predicted & herd immunity much higher. Good news.
Maybe Cybertruck will have it
"I’m dying to do super efficient, quiet home HVAC with HEPA & water distillation. It’s weird, but I really want to do it."
Good one
Will talk with team. We have a lot on our plate!
"Side camera view looks a little weird, as meant for self-driving, but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing."
"That is more reasonable, especially if mostly loans. Oil & gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time, but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy."
So shall we all
Yes
Haha sure

There are now 420 operational Starlink satellites 🛰 😉
New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan
"Pretty much. We place high value on simulation too, but nothing’s as weird as reality!"
"It’s made of a special dark foam that’s extremely radio transparent, so as not to affect the phased array antennas. Looks a lot like a car sun visor."
Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. We’re fixing it now.
Yes
They are in fact being deorbited haha
Small amount of isopropyl alcohol (cleaning fluid) was trapped in a sensor dead leg & ignited in flight
Sure hope so!
"Frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil & gas seems especially so"
Not the greatest use of money
"If this launch succeeds, we will have put up 422 satellites"

Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle & all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
Makes sense
Nice
Anything surprising?
Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
"When I talked to doctors in Wuhan, they recommended against invasive ventilators & in favor of non-invasive"
No kidding
Good article

"Definitely header tanks & nosecone on SN5, hopefully flaps too. Definitely flaps on SN6"
Crazy times!
"Red sky of Mars is

Check the warranty
Guaranteed to make any party more fun!
Thanks everyone! Still can’t believe I was born 69 days after 4/20 🤓
Yes. It will even float for a while.

"SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing & now docking with @Space_Station, which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier, since Starships dock with themselves & will be uncrewed at first."
Great platform 🤣🤣
!!
"Fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then Mars"
10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
"I sure hope so! This will inspire the world & get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind."
"Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter."
Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
Probably 3 to 6 months
"Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points"
You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive & non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.
My kids loved that one when they were little

"It’s a hard problem, mostly due to esthetics, but it’s the future we should have"
Reviewing overall system with vehicle engineering team next week. Should have number then.
"Reduced size by ~3%, center line is more level & lower window sill height"
🤣🤣
All new
"It is about 10% too small, but lots of fun 😀"
We’re working on increasing dynamic air suspension travel for better off-roading. Needs to kick butt in Baja.
Karma is real
"Yeah, super messed up"
"These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment"
Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators
Perhaps you are unaware that Twitter has a search function? The hospitals *themselves* acknowledged receipt of ventilators.
Nice
All
Interesting
So true
"Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help!"
I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. 🤣🤣

.@GavinNewsom please fix this misunderstanding
Exactly
What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo
"A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation & you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable."
Sounds about right
Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
"I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington"
We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights & stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
"They were, but are they currently?"
Interesting
"We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty."
Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
Sure
"Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet"
"SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator & static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps."

I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀
My (again) personal favorite is
"Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets & is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle."
"Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat & driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2."
SN26
"Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!"
"The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!"
"Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch"
"Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage & payload separation system also not US."
"Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips & Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation & setting PEEP & O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage."
"Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%."
"Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!"
"Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
"Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often & is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."
"Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test."
"True. Only reason other medium & heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying."
"To be clear, Fremont & Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop"
Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
That’s for sure! 😅

Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize

Hard to predict dates right now. Most likely postponed to mid May.
In about a year. Would come from Giga Berlin.
You may return the vehicle for a full refund in the unlikely event that it causes domestic discord

What is simple in one arena is often profound in another
Ok
Great differences in technology exist in the world about which even hardcore technologists are unaware
AddLabel -> PersonDressedAsCone
Certainly no problem for a 144 trillion operations per second computer to make ~15 steering/acceleration/braking maneuvers per second. That’s a trillion calculations between each output command.
"Humans drive using 2 cameras on a slow gimbal & are often distracted. A Tesla with 8 cameras, radar, sonar & always being alert can definitely be superhuman."
Cool
Aim for zero velocity just above surface & fall. You won’t fall fast.
Fine by me

"Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, we’re going to reuse much of the thrust section."
"Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe."
"Rockets & spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo."
There are redundant pressure control valves. It’s a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
"If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you’re doomed anyway, so might as well go all in"
We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
"Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2."

We’re going to simplify Plaid a little. Was getting too complex.
"Oh sure, good point. Will discuss with team & make available to buy in Tesla app."
Some progress
"Yeah, probably July 1st"
Hoping to roll out traffic lights & stops to wide US release in a few weeks & probably WW release in Q3 (so many variations in each country!). Very important to make sure this is done right.
"Homelink is 3rd party hardware that increases cost of all cars, but only some people use it, so it’s only installed upon request. Long-term, garage openers are transitioning to WiFi-activated."
Monty Python & Mel Brooks are my all-time favorites
Northwell seems to be very pragmatic & sensible. Impressive work in difficult circumstances.
And how to tell if someone’s a witch
So many brilliant scenes. Anarcho-syndicalism!
"We will see what data review says in the morning, but this may have been a test configuration mistake"
It’s true 😀
Air quality has a much bigger effect on health than people realize. Credit to Larry Page for making me aware of this.
Some valves leaked at cryo temp. Fixing & will retest soon.
🤔
High quality critical feedback from Munro & Co is much appreciated!
Sounds promising. Will be interesting to see results of clinical trials.

Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include “estimated illness onset date”. This is a significantly less rigorous standard.
C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.

C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
This meme proves it
It’s ducked!

"True. @MikeBloomberg, this is  accurate. You believe in journalistic integrity, but if something isn’t done, this will continue."
Have let @twitter know
This is messed up @MikeBloomberg

"Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water & just dump it on the ground."
"Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority & LAX customs for acting so swiftly"
"Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!"
"Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car & know when you’re expected home, so temp & humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy."
This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
"Sure would love to do home hvac that’s quiet & efficient, with humidity control & HEPA filter"
Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast & extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.
The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
🤣🤣
Will do
"Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:"
Exactly
"According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries."
Engineering ftw
Much appreciated

Have you seen more data on HCQ & Z-Pak? Hard to find.
Worrisome
Yup
We’ll try to get & deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
Nice
This is great advice
Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
"We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed & operating is the harder part."
Supply chain logistics — getting masks & other PPE to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
Panic is always dumb
"Italy: “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.”"
"Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors"
We have N95 masks & getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
No problem :)
"Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe & should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China."
"Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world"
Fair point :)

"Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too."
Up to 80% false positive
"Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."
Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”.
Important consideration
Feels like the plot of Deus Ex
"A single computer, pump & pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care & avoid cross-flow risk"
"Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too"
"That won’t work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can’t stay open"
"Yes, we’re working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won’t be needed"
Interesting thread
Thanks 💖
China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers & all of Tesla Shanghai
"We’re working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter"
"Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important."
"Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids & grandparents probably most risky."
"Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April"
Yes
No new domestic corona cases in China

"Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart:"

Yes
True
"Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already."
"Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?"
We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
Some helpful data from Italy
"Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New “confirmed” cases, not oft-reported “presumptive positive” is trending to level off over next few weeks & be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China."
0% chance of anything close
🤣🤣
How does this compare to favipiravir?
"Yeah, that will be a great milestone 😀"
"Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly, but not obviously, related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isn’t a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Won’t risk non-SpaceX satellites."
"Yeah, most reflights ever!"
"Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didn’t affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having 9 engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission."
🤣🤣
Because polygon doesn’t rhyme
Yeah

"Whether Z-pak works in this situation or not, it’s a kickass med for many maladies"
"If Jamis needs help, he has many friends, me among them"
"Pretty close. Design is evolving rapidly. Would be great to flatten domes, embed engines & add ~1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. Also, current legs are a bit too small."
Hydroxychloroquine probably better
Sounds sensible

Yeah. Fate loves irony.
What’s worse is that I even told Stanford to check me for the $^#* parasite & they still couldn’t find it!
Yeah
"I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts & sent me to ICU immediately. I was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. So, I take expert advice with a grain of salt"
Was also given a lot of doxycycline

"Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest & both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Would’ve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesn’t mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing."
Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19
👍

Probably. Raptor sounds different to Merlin.
Lot of Raptors coming through! Now operating both horizontal & vertical firing stands in McGregor.
Sure
Will discuss with team
Yes

I just sent a note to Twitter to clarify that posting SpaceX videos is fine by us and we paid for rights to Bowie song for the Falcon Heavy launch
"The competitor should be a drone fighter plane that’s remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it."
It’s not that big really
Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design
It’s not mine
Definitely! What’s in that sky city thing!?  Needs a prequel even more than a sequel.
Sure
Posting SpaceX videos is definitely not copyright infringement!
"Hopefully, in March. Checking"
I had no idea this existed. Sounds awesome though!
"Full disclosure, I’m actually a 3000 year old vampire. It’s such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!"
"We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat & strong, we’re building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement."

"Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient & range, latter factoring in route elevation changes & cargo or tow mass & drag impact"
It’s slightly better
Definitely worth trying imo
"Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights."
Active ride height & active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Science has gone too far

F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production & thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!

BGII was amazing
Getting there was super hard. Very proud of Tesla team!
Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing
"Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient & range, latter factoring in route elevation changes & cargo or tow mass & drag impact"
It’s slightly better
Definitely worth trying imo
"Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights."
Active ride height & active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Science has gone too far

These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full & rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
Probably
Attach wheels to the landing legs & tow Starship to the launch pad
I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
"High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks & fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done!"
"The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit"
"There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine."
"Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters."
"O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank"
In the order that they were written
Worth reading Asimov’s Foundation
"SN 2+ will have better fit & weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length."
The Persuader hammer will fix SN1

Maybe possible with improved wheels/tires (which would be available to all previously made cars)
All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.
Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km
Run a physics sim long enough & you’ll get intelligence
Thanks to all who caught the error 😊
a=F/m is the most fun

"The joints will have shielding, but it’s hard to ensure a good seal. Transpiration cooling (or simply higher pressure cold gas flow) would purge the area behind the hot gas seal."
Might be used around flap joints
Will take action
Only the heart senses beauty
Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds
💘 be still my beating heart 💘
"Unfortunately, Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side, but none required on leeward. Even windward shielding is very light."

This is incorrect. No air suspension planned for 3/Y. Only S/X & Cybertruck have/will have air suspension.
Æsthetics
The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics & energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
"Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass & several other products. Will also offer customer & media tours."
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
"Its integrated roof & solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"
Coming hopefully later this year
"I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice & snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!"
"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."
Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust & weathering. This pic is brand new.
Ok
Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.

You’re welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
"Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter."
"No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time."
"Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering & building a heavy duty planisher to flatten & cold work the weld area"
"That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
"This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures & welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."
"SpaceX started with a mariachi band party. Great vibes here in Boca Chica, Texas!"
True

"Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 & water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) & O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen & Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel."
This number won’t leave me alone! 🤣🤣
Just wrote a song called “Don’t doubt yer vibe”

"Ok, not so bad"
Who is hating on ISRU & why? Doesn’t make sense.

"For sure. Giga Berlin will build sustainable energy vehicles using sustainable energy, so net environmental impact will be extremely positive!"
Yes
Yes
Exactly!
Giga Berlin / GF4 will absolutely be designed with sustainability and the environment in mind
"Sounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla won’t use this much net water on a daily basis. It’s possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event. Also, this is not a natural forest — it was planted for use as cardboard & only a small part will be used for GF4."
V3 Supercharger deployment will accelerate considerably this year

"Munro’s analysis of Tesla engineering is accurate, both pro & con. I think he will appreciate some elements of the Model Y body design."
"Even more important for a a reusable rocket, as cost of propellant actually becomes relevant & anything below T/W of 1 is wasted fuel & oxygen"

"Loading the Mars fleet into Earth orbit, then 1000 ships depart over ~30 days every 26 months. Battlestar Galactica"
"Aiming for 20 to 30 years, like aircraft"
Yes. There will be a lot of jobs on Mars!
"Needs to be such that anyone can go if they want, with loans available for those who don’t have money"
Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
Yes
That’s the goal
Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
"Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at >100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit"
Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
That’s about right
Reaction to Cyberpunk 2077 slipping release date to September
"What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."
"Densification isn’t needed to return the ship & limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed"
"Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy."
"Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"
"Sorry, migh have brought the site down"

Just saw this today. Tesla refunds in general should be easy to get electronically & certainly through customer service. Will he addressed.
"Very true. What’s really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs & how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth’s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun."
"Advancing humanity’s understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant 🔭 in orbit & on moon. With an occluder, could image 🌏 in other star systems."
One person’s MRI machine is another’s railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though.
"Exactly. We’ve had good discussions with leading astronomers. One way or another, we’ll make sure Starlink doesn’t inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky."
Great song
T-shirt is bulletproof & makes u buff!
Thanks for mentioning! We should’ve done this ages ago.
"Good analysis, although a bit conservative imo. However, using a high upper bound for land area that’s *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers. That giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun outputs a truly staggering amount of energy!"
.@Space_Station
They will
We need more emojis!!
"And, of course, your car will be able to 💨 in their general direction"
For sure!! This will make for some epic robber confusion 🤣🤣
Teslas will soon talk to people if you want. This is real.
Should be able to post video of Raptor on Tripod soon
"Ok, tho could be gnarly"

Yes
Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts & better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."

Beyond awesome. He was the real deal.
Seems so long ago
Yes
"Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said."
"The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."
"Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter & more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!"
"Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn"
Coming
Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels & domes?
We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship & Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
Spin start from COPVs so the ox & fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
"Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool."
"No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 & O2 from Raptor"
Yeah

"Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts & fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."

"We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."
Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣

What is the platonic ideal of the perfect candy? Really feels like candy R&D hasn’t improved in ages. Damn candy oligarchs!! [shakes fist at sky]
"Yeah, Boring Bricks 🧱 are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!"
"Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever."
"Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else & directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
Pretty much
Sure. Trax will get much better & more fun. This is an alpha version.
"No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic & it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
"That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."
"For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."
Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.

😮
What is the platonic ideal of the perfect candy? Really feels like candy R&D hasn’t improved in ages. Damn candy oligarchs!! [shakes fist at sky]
"Yeah, Boring Bricks 🧱 are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I ♥️ crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!"
"Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever."
"Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else & directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
Pretty much
Sure. Trax will get much better & more fun. This is an alpha version.
"No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic & it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
"That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."
"For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."
Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.
❤️ you too sis
Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production & delivery teams have been working super hard.
Literally. It was at 40th & Baltimore in Philadelphia before gentrification.

"I hope someone has pics! My Mom came to visit one weekend & was quite surprised by it all, but helped work coat check & guarded the cash with a kitchen knife 🤣🤣"
"To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub & charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day  blacklights, luminescent spray paint & metal junk sculptures."
🖤 you too

Exactly
"Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone."
"This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack & suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan & a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship & debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton & Stanford."
"This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?"
"We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro & ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).

My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced & round would’ve happened anyway."
"He didn’t own an emerald mine & I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night & website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?"
Pretty much
Federal
Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.
Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.
"Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too."
"Yes, but it’s too secret"
Hopefully fully operational in 2020
"Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects"
"No, he’s still much faster 🐌"
"These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only — no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them."
Done by dawn
That would be a fringe benefit 🤣🤣

"We’re now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0."
Was up all night with SpaceX team working on Starship tank dome production (most difficult part of primary structure). Dawn arrives

It is an honor & a privilege to work with so many great engineers
The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
"It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers & merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."
Future feature
"Turn on auto navigate feature & car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all."
"Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming & video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!"
"Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) & side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."
We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
Most people still don’t know it’s there
"Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar"
"If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"

"Regarding 2.X to 3 hardware update, that should happen in earnest in Q1. Software feature delta was zero until now, so not much point in doing it before then."
"Pretty much, although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems sooner, I’d love it. The real constraint is finding great software engineers."
Ok sure
Sorry for the delay on V2.X! We just couldn’t get it all done in time.
"Unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever"
"Sorry, it’s been a bit of a struggle. Software team has been working all weekend to resolve last minute issues. Hopefully starts rolling out tonight."
"My wiki is a war zone with a zillion edits. At least it’s obviously not curated! Some day, I should probably write what *my* fictionalized version of reality is 🤣🤣"
Yes 🤣♥️
"Started Zip2 with ~$2k & ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into X/PayPal, rolled proceeds again into SpaceX/Tesla, but these are all companies where I played fundamental founding role. Not right to ask others to put in money if I don’t put in mine."
"If Tesla & SpaceX go bankrupt, so will I. As it should be."
"Just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. It’s insane! Btw, can someone please delete “investor”. I do basically zero investing."
Pre VFX cut would be $$$$

Holiday gift ideas
We’re working on moving more cars to Florida. End of year delivery is intense! Very proud of Tesla team for all their hard work.
Ok

Tesla Moth Mode (better late than never)
"Yes, just costs a few thousand dollars & is more complex than a board swap. Bunch of connectors & antennas need to change. We can improve the speed a little with software optimization, which might be enough."
I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
This is a great meme 🤣🤣
MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isn’t needed for full self-driving & cost is ~$2k for limited entertainment improvements.
"Never trust cynics, as they excuse their own bad deeds by telling themselves everyone does it"
"Yes, probably & partially"
Some good ideas here!
"Telemetry indicates soft touchdown on the water, so fairing might still be reusable"
Sigh
"Possibly Excession, but I’d recommend reading Player of Games & Surface Detail first. They’re all great."
Yes
Raptor is making great progress! Just finished an engineering review with SpaceX Propulsion. Engine SN 17 is about to ship to McGregor with some holiday style 🎄😀

We are literally a brain in a vat. The vat is your skull. Everything you think is real is an electrical signal. Feels so real though.

Blame Minecraft
smol ∩ puppy ∩ math
Plausible
Meant to say “is render speed”. Frame rate is locked.
There are 2 type of people: those who understand binary & those who don’t. And those who weren’t expecting a ternary joke.
Your DLC is $$$$
Way too many paywalls & spawn points
"Seriously, the NPC dialog tree should have more options"
Just Read the Instructions
Of course
"If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing & the tutorial is way too long"
Sure
Root of energy to mass ratio is max render speed of the simulation
Math jokes have a small audience

"They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It’s pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars."
"Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed."
"Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol."
Maybe on Starship? It’s def got the payload capacity
Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
"Yeah, it’s one of my favorite T-shirts!"
"We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck & almost died on one when I was 17."
Your Twitter comments are great btw!
Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It’s better because of you! ♥️♥️♥️
"This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs"
There will be no loss of either
"That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width"
"True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages."
We can prob reduce width by an inch & maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything
"He’s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs"

"Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year"
"Good question. It’s a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press."
Can be wrapped in any color!
The body panels will actually be laser cut!
"Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too"
Interesting idea
True
🤣🤣
Really? Ok sure.
Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
"Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity & lower part count."
⚔️ Study the Blade!! ⚔️
"We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods."
"Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger."
"Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made"
"Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press"

Yes
"Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30."

Tesla Cybertruck (pressurized edition) will be official truck of Mars
Of course
Fun party guaranteed!
Long journey

Guess I was obsessed with space from an early age. Fair point.
I’d be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. It’s like a kid’s drawing.

Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."

"Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
Pretty much
"Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting & inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
"No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous & difficult than Earth & take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
"So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
As the planets align only once every two years
A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
"Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
"If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles & each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
"Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
Gas/diesel cars too

"The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF"
Naturally
This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” & I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
"Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
More to come
Yes
Would be odd to expect anything else
"That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
"Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
Great poem
"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team & Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row."
"Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!"
"Tesla Solarglass vs 🎃 
Happy Halloween!!"
"Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong"
"Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 & 1/4 mile races."
Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!

So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas & being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
"Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important."
I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
Extremely high
Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters

Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you"
"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
And the lead character is also named Woody
"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
Conservation of energy tells you the answer
Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
"We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place & only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room & moment of inertia is much lower."
"Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.
"This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass."
"Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen & oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
"We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces."
"Yeah, great team!"
"To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth."
"Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
"Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space."
Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you"
"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
And the lead character is also named Woody
"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
Conservation of energy tells you the answer
Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
"We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place & only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room & moment of inertia is much lower."
"Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."

"Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear & drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly"
Software
Yes
Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
Venus would be very difficult
True
"Yes, we will"
"It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when & how fast to move the wipers."
"Deep Rain™️ neural net coming soon. We’re not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep."
"Yep, good catch"
♥️ hot pot
Cybertruck doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen bouncing around the Internet. It’s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.
Those rumors are false
Coming v soon
Haha
Ms. Chief & Ms. Tree

Space Jam should’ve won the Oscar
Recommended for sure. Both movies are incredible.

Solar
"Depends on total system efficiency & how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess"
"Whoa, that does look good!"
Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.
French fries 🍟 are the devil 😈
".@DrPatSoonShiong, are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?"
Super messed up situation!
Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
Should be much better at this point
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
"Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry"
"Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist."
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
"V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
"When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many & much better than driving a single car."

Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
😉
"Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
"Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive."
"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1"
Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power & no more blackouts!
Will be throughout Canada
It’s something special
Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future
True 🤣🤣
I ♥️ Asterix & Obelix!
Exactly
Ok
Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts.
All Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits.
Sooo annoying!!
We’re changing Powerwall Storm Watch to Disaster Watch. Covers more bases.

Worth reading “Human Compatible” by Stuart Russell (he’s great!) about future AI risks & solutions
All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
"We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up & received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We’re focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts."
"For what it’s worth, the SpaceX schedule, which I’ve just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon & Dragon at the Cape & all testing done in ~10 weeks"
🤣
Culture Class is really something
I hope so
We’re doomed!
Hāhā
Haha true
Done
Trouble!
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg
Agreed
Good ones
"Agreed, fair point"
Any feature requests?
"Given how quickly the world is shifting to electric vehicles, a gas/diesel vehicle bought today will probably have low resale value"

First point release update expected to go out this weekend
"Over 550,000 Tesla Smart Summon uses in first few days!"
"Thanks, Tesla team is the strongest it’s ever been & doing an amazing job! Honored to work beside them."
"If 20km works, then orbit"
Great summary of the key points!
"That’s about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot & have to be replaced."
"It’s all the “secondary” structure that concerns me, not engines & primary airframe"
"Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is <$250k for V2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine, ie <$1000/ton"
Stop sending me this 💩 🤣🤣
Agreed & such a heartwarming photo ♥️
I have that exact thought every time I get the flu
Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
Lot of ways to melt & join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently & with precise parts.
Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right & not needed with steel.
"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see"
Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back

Starship halves being joined
Summon is improving rapidly
"Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing & machining of Raptor — far more than in design of the engine itself!"
There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
Yes
"Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints & dissimilar metals at such high pressure & temperature is what I find remarkable about it."

"Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 & a skydiver."
😉
Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle & ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
"For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass & pressure."
"Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear & fwd fins during entry & landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."
Stability is not an issue with 3
"Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors & rear fins at the bottom."
"Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out."
"Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica, Texas"
Thanks!
"Either way, sustainable energy wins!!"
srsly
It’s my 🔥 glasses 😉
"Sure. Have to do it on Mars from beginning. Will ultimately do that on Earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term."
Next quarter
"Will discuss with my product team next week, but probably"
Yes
Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. The Apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem!

A 16 year old who has better reasoning & more heart than the vast majority of political leaders
That’s what life was like back in 1985
You have been warned
"No, it’s one integrated release"
"Fixing several minor bugs & a regression in highway driving, so probably early to mid next week"
Much better chess engine coming
Well said
Very meaningful action by the company that invented the internal combustion engine. People will remember this day. Respect.
Electric is the future! Congratulations Daimler!!
Nice compression
"And of course, this one, but that’s obv"

Haha

Landing leg frame
Yes
Glad you’re ok!
You never know
Exactly
"Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range"
"No, but very close"
"Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys & Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago."
Absolutely
New Roadster and X will come later
"No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before."
It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.

Wise words from Gary the Bot
"However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla & customer legal bill to be high & drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense."
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at  .
"Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California & one Gigafactory (for batteries & drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide."
"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
"That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
Agreed
"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
"There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
"Hopefully, next year"
"Personally, I think the universe looks great for 12 billion years, let alone 13.8"
Sagan was awesome
They used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your  along the Thames River in London
Haha exactly!

This is technically a Speedraptor
"Autopilot active crash prevention keeps getting better, as we examine every crash for improvement & then upload smarter software. Ironically, I hope we’re never on the list!"
v^2/r is fun haha
"Makes it clear that you can only sense acceleration, not velocity"
The downward spiral
Good point
To carry 7 people
Model S at Nürburgring has 7 seats
All great! ♥️ Mel Brooks
Spaceballs
Flux capacitor option package
Yes
Soon
"Yes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production & applies to S,X & Roadster, but not 3 or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors."
No
The only thing beyond Ludicrous is Plaid

This could be good
"But we probably won’t try for best lap time this week, as we need to review & tune Model S thoroughly for safety on Nürburgring, especially Flugplatz section"
Model S is already there
"Model S just set record for fastest 4 door ever at Laguna Seca, video tmrw"

Getting ready for flight of orbit-class Starship design
Aargh!!
"No, but that was an epic piece at a time when the word was being overrun by demented versions of an otherwise delightful jam container. It was like World War Z, but mason jars"

The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration & acoustics.
48 61 20 68 61
"The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
"Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
Precisely
"Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok."
🤣🤣
You know destination weather before departure & there’s no weather in space
"Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins."
"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell & fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability."
"Over time, 355 & 385 are possible, but very difficult"
Most likely
Photoshop is amazing
"Sea level Raptor’s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle"
For sure
Actually true

"For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains."
Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.

Probably 2 to 3 months. We’re about to ship Raptor SN 10.
Probably 18m for next gen system

Dragon Crew Arm. Astronauts will walk this gantry to enter Dragon & depart for the @Space_Station.
Dronship with wings folded traveling through Panama Canal
Interesting
Not that I know of
"Yes, rather embarrassing tbh"
Impressively accurate analysis!
Hopefully next year
♥️♥️♥️
Appears to be a wiring/connector issue
Igniters need to be inspected. We will try again tomorrow same time.
"Raptor uses dual redundant torch igniters. Better long-term, but more finicky in development."
About 5 mins from flight attempt
Starhopper flight currently tracking to 5pm Texas time for 150m / ~500ft hover test

About 5 mins from flight attempt
Starhopper flight currently tracking to 5pm Texas time for 150m / ~500ft hover test
"Finally, VR that’s cool *and* sexy!"
Oh behave u naughty planet  😉
😢
It’s quite robust
Where are additional Superchargers most needed?
World’s first very large scale battery has worked out well
"Yes, last flight for Hopper. If all goes well, it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor."
Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
"Agreed, that’s the right future"
Looks like @SpaceX Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
We’re working closely with EU regulators & hope to clarify the timeline soon
Ok
Should be soon
"If you’re a utility or public utilities commission, please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment & usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants!"
"Yes, probably within next 6 to 9 months"
Tesla is working hard to help stop global warming
🤣🤣👍👍
The Nude Scientisté
Looks like a wheel of cheese
Ok
"We need to complete internal QA testing for safety, which will hopefully be done in about 4 weeks"
Wow
Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes"
"Not risky imo & can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun)."

"True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids & a mass driver, but this is risky."
"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
"Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins & landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
"Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth & gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming"
🤣🤣
Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
"AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based."
"Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters"
"Initially Model 3, later Y"
Looking forward to seeing Giga Shanghai soon 😀 Amazing work by Tesla China team & support of authorities much appreciated!
Not yet
This is a great idea
🤣🤣
Um I ate most of it
Cookie decorating contest with kids
Converts about 5 million tons of mass to energy every second
"Great name! Wouldn’t worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit Earth eventually & we currently have no defense."
"Don’t know yet, but it’s important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so we’ll make costs as low as possible"

"With the new lower Tesla pricing, it’s like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious."
Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think
Which means a small corner of Texas  (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire United States
1 Gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches Earth’s surface
In a few years
"Yeah, legs are hydraulic pistons & abdomen is the accumulator"
Generates a *lot* of energy
It is quite silly
Meaning less than a century. But this would be pretty intense.
"Aspirationally, decades"
The sun is an immense thermonuclear explosion fyi
Yes
"Not saying it solves everything, mind you, but it’s a step in the right direction"
"Yeah, the trick is opening & closing the spacesuit helmet really fast"
Stop hashtagging me 🤣
Perhaps that one was too edgy
Hashtags are an abomination
"No, as better to vary thickness with vehicle height, but this is the right way to go for Boring Co tunnels reinforcement imo"

Nuking Mars one T-shirt at a time
Simulations all the way down
"Trust me, it will be 🔥🔥"
"Hey babe, fancy a hot date ? 😉 @4thFromOurStar"
It’s not boring
Of course!
T-shirt soon
Guess I sort of am already
I’d play that game
Nuke Mars!
This isn’t correct. Will address.
Good conversation with head of FAA Space. Need a bit more hazard analysis & should be clear to fly soon.
Am talking to @FAA in a few hours
"Stacking fairing & tanks soon, then adding control fins, engines & landing gear"
That was my actual password at one point!
Stop posting my password on twitter!
Coming
"Tesla audio engineers come from B&O & many other companies. They literally rōq. Our system is highly programmable, so we keep improving it via OTA codec updates."

True
No but srsly don’t do it
Roughly
Ok
Possibly two weeks
Try playing Powerglide in your Tesla at volume 11
Working on upgrades to Sentry
No plans to introduce air suspension on Model 3 at this time
"Watching a movie on Tesla V10.0 is great, in large part due to the sound system"
Obviously needed
He would our first openly goth president. I think this is very important.
I support Yang
When Opportunity knocks
Passing fad. Like steam engines. They look cool in a museum.
Because our universe is actually a microverse in a miniverse. We probably just power someone’s brake lights.
"Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge 🤣🤣"

"Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes"
"Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully & immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design & build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real."
"Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B"
"Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla & non-Tesla solar panels"
Yes
Between $100B and $10T
Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
For sure
Yup
Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
Gas cars are so last-century!
Priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with FSD
"We’re accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!"
"Probably every 2 to 4 months, depending on how much progress we make"
Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke!
FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue
Thanks for reminding me. Will rectify.
Tons of fun!
Tesla software V10 is lookin real good! Releasing to early access list soon

"Don’t know enough about George’s company, but it sounds like he’s focused on a machine vision approach, which is the only general solution imo"
"Yeah, George is a little nuts, but I like him & he often has interesting things to say"
No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
"Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights."
Thanks George!
"We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world."
But actual road data is what matters most
"Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident."
"Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff"
Well said!
Ok

No
"Vandenberg is great for polar orbits. Will still play an important role long-term, but 80%+ will be eastward."
"Great progress by Starship Cape team. Started several months behind, but catching up fast. This will be a super fun race to orbit, moon & Mars!"
"So much drama & good times too! Maybe worth a book one day, but would come at expense of 🚀 & 🚘 & 🧠."
Headed to Starship Cape Canaveral build site today
Just left Starship Texas build site. Very proud of progress SpaceX team has made! Pics are of 9m dome rotation & Starship airframe behind windbreak.
Lyft/Uber/taxi drivers are expert Tesla advocates. Thanks for your support!!
Yes
Progress is accelerating

Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
Never thought we’d make it this far

"Btw, you can schedule service via the Tesla app in less than a minute"
Good point. Getting fixed
Probably 1/4 to 1/2 of that capacity would be for stationary storage
Launch underway
"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"
Pc (chamber pressure) high due to colder than expected propellant
Thin tiles on windward side of ship & nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
"Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe."
Wearing black not recommended
"High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective."

Won’t change. Starship launch structure will be attached to the other side from tower.
Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
2 to 3 months after that
It *is* vision
I suspect many besides SpaceX will livestream these flights. Won’t be subtle.
Texas and Florida Starship prototypes (not Hopper) fly in 2 to 3 months

Yes
Tesla Service Centers & Superchargers are being opened as fast as possible across Eastern Europe
"This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket & space station technology. Great respect."
"No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot"
"Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you’d expect."
Maybe end of next year
Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications

"Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP"
"“If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.” — Gen Shinseki"
"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit."
Probably
Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them & we won’t be able to."
"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"
Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.

SpaceX thruster package will be subtle. Hidden behind license plate.
Haha yes
"Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers."
"Yeah, that’s next after summon"
"Will trace back inertial measurements & wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off"
"Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year"
Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
"Agreed, it’s a small, but important, feature"
Ok
🔥
"Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs"
Take note
"About right, but dangerously chuggy & risking bad things at 40%. We’ll keep it above 50% for this flight."
"More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin θ/2, as I recall, but doesn’t matter, as there’s no geo 🛰 anywhere near that mass."
3
"100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never."

True
Exactly
No
No
"There is no “refreshed” Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production 3 months ago."
This shampoo sounds amazing
No problem

"Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising."
Exactly
Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
"To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car"
"Between first development engine & first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware & software. Over time, thousands."

Upgrading to 250kW soon
"Intersections with complex traffic lights & shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety."
Local supporters will be invited!
Yes
~Q4 2016
"End of Q4, most likely"
"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k & make at least ~500k FSD cars
All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer & all production in past few months has FSD computer

"Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident & do our best to minimize probability of recurrence."
"We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth & becoming multiplanetary via Mars. It’s not clear how much time we have to do these things, but sooner is definitely better."
Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians & cyclists especially.
Should be fixed soon
Reason for top rating is that active steering & braking safety features of Tesla Autopilot are turned on no cost for all cars
✌️
Congratulations Tesla team & thanks to all the new Tesla owners!! ♥️♥️

Is this true @CGrantWSJ?
"FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years."
"Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less & convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines"
"Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves."
Huge thanks to all Tesla supporters around the world helping the cause. We ♥️♥️♥️ you!!

"We poured our heart & soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Fabergé egg of cars."
"Hardly anyone noticed, but still"
We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
Design & production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible
2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
That’s actually kinda true
Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
"~1000, as all seats would be “coach” & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
"About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher & stability of booster in ground winds is low"
There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
"Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
"Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work."
Probably sooner
Ok

Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.

Falcon Heavy on LC-39A
"All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox & fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness & needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗"
It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock & strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals & bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
So cool
"Yeah, that sounds ideal! I love the KSC rocket garden. Spent many days there looking at rocket design details."
Uh oh
Ok

Excessive shades of grey
"Yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous."
"Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy & immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps."
Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
Haha
Depends on destination
"Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level"
"Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."
Chomsky sucks
"Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite"
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
"More than that now, but <10% of that in volume, although much to be proven"
"Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
"Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design & replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."
"For sure moon 1st, as it’s only 3 days away & u don’t need interplanetary orbital synchronization"
Moon too

"Exactly. And many areas of countries showing good Internet actually have poor or no access, so those are important to address too."
One of my favorite original Roadster colors!
How about baby pink?
Reminder that US federal tax drops by $1875 for any Tesla delivered after June 30. Order online at  .
"Changing the palette is hell on service, because cars last for 20 years. Every color change has a long tail of hurt, especially for Model 3."
A simple white (not pearl multi-coat)
"Starting next month, Tesla will charge $1000 for color black (same price as silver)"
Will consider
This will be our most difficult launch ever
But on the inside
Original Star Wars
Sole meunière
Probably fine. Some Tesla taxis in Amsterdam have 3 times that mileage.
"Actually, I stole it from my secret meme dealer #moneygang"
"🎶 Non, je ne regrette meme 🎶"

Overall master plan should be explained. I think it still makes sense if we don’t consider AI 2b other.
I’ve been tweeting strange shit since Ramses II. He was a great pharaoh!
Might get pushed to next month. Starhopper flight first. Waiting on engine repair.
"10 years ago, SpaceX server room was named Skynet as a joke. Fate 🖤 irony."
Thanks 😀
Model 3 arriving in UK
Good question. Will consider thoughtful response.
By far
"Good analysis. Both computers will be used & sync ~20 times per second. This is a long time to a computer. Like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one."

Can’t fool me it was 1669
Sounds about right
Don’t make me challenge you to a rap battle!!
Fair point
"Yeah, dual motor AWD is super fun!"

RWD with all-weather tires works great. Tesla traction control is an order of magnitude more precise than gas/diesel. Really helps to have Newton & Maxwell on your side.
Thanks Bob! He is a tough critic.

"Storm Watch was active for hundreds of Powerwall customers this weekend as a result of @NWS Red Flag Fire Warnings in California, and we will continue to activate it whenever there advance awareness of a potential power outage or physical danger"
Absolutely agree. Major expansion of service centers underway.
Super fair criticism. We’re putting max resources on this. Hard to hire enough repair technicians in Norway! Please apply if interested.
💖🇳🇴 Norway 🇳🇴💖
"Good point. Maybe we could collect rainwater, add a little antifreeze in cold climates & make it last for years."
Annual tire rotation is actually optional. Only worthwhile if you see significant differential wear on inside vs outside of tire.

"Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. That’s 57,600/hour/lane & you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput & convenience."
Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them.

"Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further"
Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto & oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors & space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
"Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity & ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20."
"Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result."
Wings/flaps & leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn’t affect schedule much though.
Not bad
Exactly. We’re on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
"Yeah, the fear, uncertainty & doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights"
I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
"One day’s grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow."

"Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits & arrays are tracking to sun."
"Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
"Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy."
"Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers"
"If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map."
"There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully & will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible."
"No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."
Fair
Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy & internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites & allow some amount of yaw steering.
"Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
"Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density & thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp & up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."

"Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side & complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber."
Horizontally
"First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20."
So it goes
3 months
"Hopefully, 4 months"
Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly & at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move & increases moment of inertia.
"Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees"
Sure
Two tunnels about a mile long each
Yes
"Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!"
"Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth"
N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces & high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
"Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX, looking at rocket"
"Part of the factory is being upgraded, but tours will continue around the parts that aren’t"
"Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full."

"3 sea level optimized Raptors, 3 vacuum optimized Raptors (big nozzle)"
"After the GoT finale, we dropped it to 6"
"Mk1 & Mk2 ships at Boca & Cape will fly with at least 3 engines, maybe all 6"
"About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer"
Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in 2 months. Aiming to finish by end of year.
"The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer & impellers."
"But, essentially, the spinning things"
Yes
"Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer & 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower."
😉
Did it for the memes
Coming soon
"Yeah, been thinking about it for a long time. Electric supersonic VTOL. Hard problem."
Hopefully in about 10 days
Physics favors full flow
Good design imo
Thanks Sam!
Good piece on lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles

Sorry to hear that. Will fix.
Ok
Easy to turn one of our Starlink satellites into a debris collector
Yes
Almost ready. I’m testing it personally this weekend.
Yes
Also porting Unreal Engine
Nintendo won’t let us
"Maybe so eventually, but it will be information & entertainment, not trickery"
"Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead, we use that money to make the product great."
We def need racing game using actual car steering wheel & pedals!
Sure
Of course
Portal 1 & 2 on this would rock
Would be great to have @Roblox & @Minecraft!
"Interact with games via touchscreen, steering wheel buttons & XBox/PS controllers"
Lots more games coming once we finish porting Unity!
Top Secret
"It technically could, but wouldn’t have enough mass margin for a heat shield, landing propellant or legs, so not reusable"
"No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives & forks are made of."

"Because a Tesla produces no emissions & filters most toxins, pollen, spores & viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels"
Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways.
This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S & X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters.

√-1 2^3 3.14 😋
Set of all math jokes that are actually funny is pretty small (sigh)
"Physics demands the impedance of resistance, because it’s not real"
What makes resistance complex is that it’s half imaginary!
Glad it worked out
Congratulations @kitkitschool & @onebillion on creating great open source literacy software!
"6 more launches of 60 🛰 for initial activation, 12 for significant coverage"
"Starlink mission will be heaviest @SpaceX payload ever at 18.5 tons. If all goes well, each launch of 60 satellites will generate more power than Space Station & deliver 1 terabit of bandwidth to Earth."
🏴‍☠️
That’s about right
Probably start installing end of next month
"SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10."

Completely agree. Every Tesla should have good art & music creation software.
It is flat-packed. No dispenser.
That *might* not be my lucky 🍀 number
"More details on day of launch, currently tracking to Wednesday"
"Much will likely go wrong on 1st mission. Also, 6 more launches of 60 sats needed for minor coverage, 12 for moderate."
"These are production design, unlike our earlier Tintin demo sats"
"If static fire 👍 on Mon, 🚀 on Tues"
First 60 @SpaceX Starlink satellites loaded into Falcon fairing. Tight fit.

But putting the word “Blue” on a ball is questionable branding
Competition is good. Results in a better outcome for all.

Turns out there’s more ways to use Autopilot than we imagined
Soon
Baby Thanos?

I was just there about a month ago
Probably shouldn’t have called holding company Cyberdyne Systems 😔
"Just behind the glovebox, which is, presumably, where the gloves are"
"He’s just kidding, folks, but best to turn car off just in case. Also 2001 was 18 years ago."
Mein Herz brennt is👌boss fight song

"Even though lease cost is lower, I recommend purchase, as buyer retains upside value of car vs lease where you have give it back to Tesla"
"Model 3 Standard Range+ with Autopilot lease is $399/month at  , but lots of other EVs available:"
We’re closing the loop on Autobahn driving. Will improve dramatically in coming months. Ultra gemütlich.
Oh. They have nice pictures there.

🇫🇮🖤 Finnish Metal Rocks 🖤🇫🇮
One of the biggest reusability improvements was fast leg stow. Version 1 sometimes took days.
"In recent years, hours were much higher. Don’t recommend though — bad for health & happiness. But no choice or Tesla would die. Hope to reduce to 80 hours next year."
Been wanting to go ever since that Finnish metal band won
💙

"Not to be taken literally, of course. He means any maker of dairy products."
"Wow, how did they take this video!?"
Yes
Looks about 18 light-minutes away
Relatively speaking
"Space is easy, orbit is hard"
"SpaceX needs to demonstrate more progress with Starship, but that will hopefully happen rapidly"

Physics is a set of compression functions for the simulation
It’s pretty much the only theory. This will mess with your mind:
Sensors are for the weak. Just go open loop.

"Quantum mechanics was harder than all my other courses combined, but so incredible"
"NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs."
I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
"21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can’t transfer data fast enough between computer & GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant."

"Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year & thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
"Those who predicted Tesla & EVs would be dead & autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars & autonomy was between 10 years & never

"Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) & we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year."
"As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost & larger range pack needed."
Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone
Anyone who did this analysis should interview at Tesla
Upgrading hardware is not important for a few months
Is that a real billboard?
We’ll let the NN loose on Track Mode one day  that’ll be insane
Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark
Or maybe pegging
"On yeah, that too"
"Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds."

"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
"Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year & thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
"Those who predicted Tesla & EVs would be dead & autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"

I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport & energy
"Good point, small oil is a problem too"
"I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal & gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels"
"Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false."
"True, Bloomberg is almost as bad"
Holman Jenkins & WSJ in general are sock 🧦 puppets of big oil
Starship is kinda Gundam
"Very much so. There are 2.5B cars & trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -> demand >> supply."
"Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner."

"Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve."
"There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
Yes
"Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date"
"Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn’t cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability"
Yes
"There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase"
"Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
Something like that
Starting May 1
Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time

Model 3 drive unit & body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.
Cool

Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability >> human.
It will enable video when parked & connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.

Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
Impressive analysis
"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera."
"Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows & rear window."
"It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."
Will take care of it

Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower & allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
Agreed
Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.

C++ syntax sucks
"Assert (“Money” == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);"
Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
Like the movie Us. Scary  but also empathetic.
"No, but for sure the other way around!"
"Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest"
"We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot & fast, so dicey."
"Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare."
"Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer & max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
"Probably no fairing either & just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible."
"Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."
Anyone who bought FSD will get it
"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 & HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."
Yes. Sensitive propulsion & avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
"Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow."
"We should send probes to outer solar system & get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there’s an alien artifact out there"
Super cool!
Good point
"Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate."

"Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained.

Yes, but we’re going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads."

"Yes, full duration"
White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin
"Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint."
Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.
No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles
"Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots"
Only some of the hottest sections
Full size
We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don’t need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
"You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump & combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber."
"Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship & Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations."
Agreed
"Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We’re simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed."
"Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout"
"Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine & stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely."

"Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations & we try to build in batches to simplify production"
"Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer"
"Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity."
"Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions."

Model S will be raised to 162mph too
Thank you. May you have good luck and godspeed with your spacecraft!
"Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also, thank you to @NASA, without whom this would not be possible."
Power will increase on all cars. Top speed on 3P increases to 162mph. Range on RWD 3 increases to 325 miles.
"Yes, new cars and existing fleet"
Firmware update coming later this month will increase power by ~5% & top speed by 10 km/h or 7mph
Spoiler alert: not Porsche
Thank you on behalf of the many people of SpaceX
Lightning bolt right before launch

Need to get back to SpaceX launch control. Sorry this solution isn’t perfect.
"We’re trying to make EVs & autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company."
Will take a few days for system update
"Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back."

"If you bought a Tesla before yesterday’s price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less)"
He is the sensor!
"Nope, he’s going to float around in zero gravity"
Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!
Happy birthday!
"Yeah, just use a dryer outlet. High power, easy to install & low cost."
Explanation from Tesla later today
Yes
Haha
Ripley
"Base Model 3 available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia 6 to 8 months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes & import duties mean price may be 25% or more above US number."
Exactly
No reductions from here
For sure. It fundamentally improves quality of life.
Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot
Exact Tesla Model 3 in my profile pic costs $35k before incentives & takes 1 minute to buy online at
I think we should do something here. Will talk with team & send out a note in next few days.
Should be ~5% peak power increase with March 15 software release

"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder."
"Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
"Yes, exciting potential"
Exactly
"Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet."
Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.

"Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
"Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."
"SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing  🤗"
Oh hi lol
"Fate *loves* irony. Frankly, too much."
Meetings are a valuable use of time!
There’s a 🐜 in my 👟 🤣

Great meme review hosted by Will Smith
Haha true
It’s designed to be way better. We’ll see what reality has to say about that.
"Yes, lot of risk"

Focusing on Starship instead
Deorbits & burns up over the Pacific
"Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads & Dragon abort thrusters."
"Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so"
"Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."

"High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
Yes 😀
Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April.
Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
SN2 has changes that should help
To the first part. I doubt we’d create a Dyson ring or sphere.
Yes
"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done."
"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
"That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."

"SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years."
"Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
So true 🤡 John Clarke 👌
"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure & temperature in oxygen preburner"
Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
"That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don’t have any crypto holdings."
"I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes."
"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k."
Won’t be long before they do
"Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019"

Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
Pics are so clear in space!
That last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like
"Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI & I didn’t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up & it was just better to part ways on good terms."
I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering & manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) & SpaceX
"To clarify, I’ve not been involved closely with OpenAI for over a year & don’t have mgmt or board oversight"

The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
At least 10X cheaper
"Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k & maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth & move to Mars if they want."
Yes
"This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
Close
"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."

Joe Rogan describes Tesla for 4 mins & 20 secs
"Booster center of mass is much lower & more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
"Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
"Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
"Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
"The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” & sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"

Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
"Design requires at least 170 metric tons of force. Engine reached 172 mT & 257 bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means 10% to 20% more with deep cryo."
Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship & Super Heavy
"Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow."
We’re doing everything we can to get there. It’s a super hard grind.
"Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other & lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, it’s way better."
VAT of ~20% & import duties of ~10% usually result in a 30% higher cost in Europe

"Gaseous CH4/O2 & heavy duty spark plugs. Basically, a 💨 of insane power 😀"
"Will do, although SpaceX reddit is very well-informed. Really impressive analysis by some commenters."
Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.
First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine! So proud of great work by @SpaceX team!!
We will when it rolls out
Yes
Vaporized some copper
Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
"Design requires at least 170 metric tons of force. Engine reached 172 mT & 257 bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means 10% to 20% more with deep cryo."
Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship & Super Heavy
"Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow."
We’re doing everything we can to get there. It’s a super hard grind.
"Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other & lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, it’s way better."
VAT of ~20% & import duties of ~10% usually result in a 30% higher cost in Europe

At @SpaceX Texas with engineering team getting ready to fire new Raptor rocket engine
soon
Only a matter of time
That might be the ultimate superpower
How Model 3 performs on a long road trip
"I’m openly moderate. There, I said it."
Haha how is this even real?
"No, payload will actually increase"
Exactly
I do like nonsense memes. It’s true.
Yes
Next few days
💩 looks like sentient choc ice cream
Just bought   oh yeah
Whoa cool
No plans to do so. Would recommend Model S.

"We’ll tweak the alloy over time, so it won’t exactly be 301, but close"
"Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart"
"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher & doesn’t even need paint!"
Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
Mostly true
"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps & main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
Yes
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship & booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) & sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas
Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
"To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature & reduced need for heat shielding"
"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime & angle of attack"
Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar
"About 10 orbit synch windows, which are every 26 months, so self-sufficiency around 2050"
All our patent are belong to you
"Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day"
Exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market! We created Tesla to accelerate a sustainable future & it’s happening!
Tasty food!

"But, occasionally, the metal version"
Haha
Tesla Sentry Mode will play Bach’s Toccata and Fugue during a robbery (and keep Summer safe)
"All doors unlock automatically when the Tesla comes to a stop after an accident. There is both primary & backup power to doors, brakes, steering & airbags."
Cool that this is happening on many fronts. Looks like a good design by @Boeing.
"Yeah, worked on my cousin’s farm for six weeks around my 18th birthday. I was so kewl."
Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software
So tempting
It’s like looking in a mirror!
That would be so cool!
"Yes, and my grandfather was from Minnesota with some Scandinavian/German background. Got to hand it to Norway. That’s a great sculpture!"

Actual tanks are fine
"~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel."
I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night & fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
"310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp"
Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
"Since it’s part of safety & security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it"
Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
"Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze & block cooling channels."
Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings & signs in each country.
"When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water"
untrue

Tesla is the safest car according to US govt testing
"I wish them well. Track record in auto startups is tough. Thousands of US auto startups, but only Ford & Tesla have avoided bankruptcy. A similar scenario is likely in all countries."
Wow
Yup
"Thanks, good idea!"
"Yes, ending on Feb 1. It’s adding too much cost to the cars, especially Model 3."
Order must occur before Feb 1
"No, the whole referral incentive system will end"
"The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb 1. If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla & give them 6 months of free Supercharging, please do so before then."
I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
"Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it’s not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings"
How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
"Teslarati is very thoughtful & well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX"
"The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX & Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication"
"The source info is incorrect. Starship & Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport."
Haha you’re welcome! Hope you’re doing well.
"About $15M/km for a two way high speed transit, so probably around $750M plus maybe $50M/station"

Vertically or horizontally?
No problem
"Plus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance"
I don’t think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.
I’m not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the 2 rear seats.

"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:"
"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
"There are also many state & local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities & access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"

Yes
"Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side"
Glad you’re ok!
Starship will look like liquid silver
Yep
Yes
"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
"Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities & working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
Ok
Wow!
"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

Stainless Steel Starship
Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
When it’s no longer noticeable over Planck’s length
Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
Engineering is true magic
Yezzz
How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities
Please put “invented car fart” on my gravestone. This is my only request.
Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."

"It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
"You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo."
"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level."
Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
"Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word “star” or “link” 😀"
"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster & orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well & thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons & Mars."
Coldformed at cryo
"This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height & diameter."
We’re building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
Exactly
"For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry."
Yes
"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel & we’re using a different alloy mix. I super ♥️ 300 Series Stainless!"
"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys & new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
"If Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
Coming soon

"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference:"
Join our underground movement!
"Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) & tow or flatbed it out"
Ok 😀💨
Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
Exactly
"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber & a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp & elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators & I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
"You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear."
"Pop up, park and walk!"
I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles & let people decide what makes them happy"
"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated & belted for high speed safety."
Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).

"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination & then drives on normal roads back to start"
"Actually way more capacity, way faster & way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better."
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians & cyclists
"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
Yes
"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
Tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train & back again
Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight
Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
Same applies to those who didn’t order PUP
Exactly. It’s a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
"Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago!"
"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers & cell phones. It takes many design iterations & vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability."
Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX & Tesla!
Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel’s Founder’s Fund: “we have no concerns whatsoever.”

The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats & just wipe it off.
Congratulations!
"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in 2 weeks, even if you haven’t placed an order yet"
You got it
Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build & interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
👍
Zero Suit 😉
God Fire
💕🍜 ramen is sooo good🍜 💕
Exactly 😀
This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound.
You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
"Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”."
About 10 to 14 days
"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. 

To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at   or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.

Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be."
Probably next month
You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
"We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
Probably end of next year

"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability."
"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs & roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars & takes highway interchanges & off-ramps."
Machete!!
"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later."

Yes
Interesting
"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
The new design is metal
"As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint."
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.
Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump & lines."
We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged & is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes
Us too sigh
"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out & launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
64 satellites 🛰 on this flight!
"We’re adding police car, fire truck & ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop & turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."

Ok
Good advice
Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
Glad you’re ok
"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
"Incoming rocket & fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
You got it!
"Three things, one of which is CH4"
No
No
"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Can’t wipe it off."
Haha
"Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience."
"Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC."
True ♥️
It is so hard to move in armor!
You’re all hired!
Yes  no  maybe

Ok
Good advice
Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
Glad you’re ok
"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
"Incoming rocket & fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
You got it!

Yes
"This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
"You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent."
"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."

Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
"No, it’s got enough load capacity & volume to carry the battery pack & our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."

"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts & processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
"Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
Ok
Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
Absolutely agree
Investigating
Probably mid 2019
Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
Should be possible. Please ask service & lmk response.
"No, but perhaps in a few years"
"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
Will allow having your car picked up & dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed
Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps
"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA & USAF are supportive."
Radical change
"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."

"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe & Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
We bought some trucking companies & secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload & direct to owner location."
Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30

Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
Exactly. That’s Monday.
"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
"No, but I will"
Isn’t it obvious?
Worth it
Cool haha
"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer & secretary. Guess I have to keep 1st one or it will confuse the authorities."
"Good point, might put that one back"
Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. I’m now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
"Don’t worry, we’ll make it right"
The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
"It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action"
"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?"
We will enable track mode for all performance cars
"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund & free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."

True
Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
Haha
"On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%."
Lacks scale
"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
"Reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real Reddit"
Exactly
You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
"On Twitter, likes are rare & criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great."
Glad you’re ok @tylerthecreator
"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model 3, so bikes can fit in trunk"
Hey that’s my Halloween costume!
Good question
"Clearly, you’re not reading my twitter"
I wish
Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases.
Yes Zorbix

Fresh puro from my meme dealer
Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
"Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements & no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone."
Massive thanks to Tesla owners & supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you.
Same
2025
How’d they know!?
Around mid 2019
"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit & finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening.
"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S & X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."
"Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
Working on it
That is correct
Twitter thought I got hacked & locked my account haha
Wanna buy some Bitcoin? 😉😉

"This is a ~ 6000 ft demo tunnel. First operational, high-speed tunnel still set for Chicago, pending regulatory approvals."
Under LA (Hawthorne)
155 mph | 250 km/h
Opening event that night & free rides for the public next day

"It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow & ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires."
"It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model 3 & super simple new order page"
Week or two
Love the Reddit comments too

New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
"Yes, aiming for next few months"
"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months & all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America & realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
Insightful article by David @Pogue

I believe it’s $5k
~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."
"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
Still a long way to go
Model 3 motor & gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
Works best if you play games full screen & use steering wheel scroller balls for control
Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now 😀

Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
Maybe wise to bring it just in case 👽👾 😉
About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth & half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens & we destroy ourselves
You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Don’t have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
Yes
"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."

Beautiful picture
"Yes, it’s hard to find. Not sure why."
"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSA’s *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
This is incorrect

No such thing as a “full refresh” at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
It sure does. Very reliable.
You are right

"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds & small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.

"The big funds can & will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking."
"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively & consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market & without clear consent of the shareholder"
"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors & retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base & gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
I hope to be less wrong over time
You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
What they do should be illegal
The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.

"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
"If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."

True
Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? It’s what they do.
Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
Great verdict 😀
Could be worse 😇
"Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar & side repeater camera neural nets just right."
Something especially weird going on with Yahoo news feed on iPhone stocks app. Almost always super negative. Maybe getting gamed.
Naughty by Nature 😉
Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
That was intense
i❤️🇨🇦
!! Will take action.
And remember
Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!

"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
😀
"Apologies, we’re upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
Tricky one
"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun & morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"

"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear & still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia & other important car terms at
"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling & driving feel. Extremely important metric."
A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
You’re welcome. Sorry for the delay!
What would be great is original Elite
Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
♥️ Tesla Owners ♥️
"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
😀
"Apologies, we’re upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
Tricky one
"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun & morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
Probably 2028 for a base to be built

Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
"Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."

Yusaku will be bringing 8 (brave) artists & cultural figures with him on the journey around the moon!
Probably V10 alpha build
"Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1."
Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied & this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
Thank you for your trust in the @SpaceX team. Greatly appreciated.
Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. It’s not sustainable long-term.

"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night"
This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?

Those are the new design made of titanium. Doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
"Sorry, meant to say same timeframe as hardware"
Yes
Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot.

Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.
Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)"
No change
Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private
Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
Yes
I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.

Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.
Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)"
No change
Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private
Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
Yes
I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.
Good morning 😀

Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
Maybe Thursday
Great work by @OpenAI. Need the neural interface soon to enable human/AI symbiosis.
We’re working on a new Tesla mini-car that can squeeze in an adult
Yes
"Model S P100D is def still the top end, but Model 3 Performance is higher value for money"
"Early access will have bugs (usually minor, but you never know for sure), so would not advise early access unless you’re prepared to have something go wrong"
🖤 Tesla Autopilot Team 🖤
Everywhere
Much more interesting
"Games & other refinements will go to all Tesla S, X & 3 from start of production. Autopilot enhancements apply to all Model 3’s plus S & X made in last few years (needs Autopilot Hardware V2.0 or higher)."
Glad you’re enjoying Model 3 & thanks for buying a Tesla! Major enhancements to Autopilot & fun games coming in a month with V9.0.
Yup
Def worth it. Model 3 Performance is next-level.

Will work with current hardware. OTA update.
Definitely
Bioshock is amazing
"Something like that, but more of an adults in cars anime vibe"
Please send examples of prior work when applying. Looking for max playability & creativity.
"If you’re into video game development, consider applying to Tesla. We want to make super fun games that integrate the center touch screen, phone & car irl."
😛
Cool idea!
Good idea & thanks for Supercharger trophy reminder. Really want to make the car as fun as possible!
Yup
"Hoping to include last three in this release, with pole position linked to actual car steering wheel (while stationary tbc haha)"
We will try to squeeze it in
What are your favorites?

Tesla body shops are ramping up fast. Aiming to go from 30+ days using external body repair shops to same day body repair with prestocked parts at Tesla service centers.
Will leave any comment on actions in Flint to those in Flint
Can’t wait to bring Tesla to Brazil. One of my favorite countries!
We should be really worried about this
No
"Yeah, Model 3 is designed to fit 6’4”  adults comfortably in both front & rear seats at same time"
"We’re adding a “party & camper mode” soon to S/3/X, so your car can maintain air flow, temp, selective lights, music & power devices for 48 hours or more while parked. Big batteries rock"
"Not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means there’s room for trunks in front & back, plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car"
Hard drive industry is hardcore. They build >100 million units per year with extreme precision & brutal economics. Great background.
"There’s a massive amount of CO2 on Mars adsorbed into soil that’d be released upon heating. With enough energy via artificial or natural (sun) fusion, you can terraform almost any large, rocky body."
"Yes, minifloats"
Yes
"We tried out a new delivery system using an enclosed trailer straight from factory to owner’s home, so super convenient & car arrives in pristine condition without wasting plastic wrap"

We’ve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. It’s like hitting a square wave.
"We’re trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be “tap here & you get your car”. Then, if you don’t like it for any reason, just return it like any other product."
Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
"Wow, that’s really awesome. Thank you! ♥️@TeslaOwnersUK"
Haha
"Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard."
Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.

Congratulations to all teams in the student @Hyperloop competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
"Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap “maintain” & your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked."
"Yes, Tesla Model S, X & 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked"
Ok

"Btw, 1792 is calling & wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime & save lives of many birds."
No kidding
"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
"Phew 😅. Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago & people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?

Definitely. We gave up some grip & width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires & wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims & tires.
"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"

"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."
"As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader."
Good point
I have never donated to a SuperPAC
"Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone."
Actually true
Hold up a mirror & see if it fogs

Safe to lick. I checked.

Just finished an amazing 3 day visit to China. The world has never seen human energy & vigor at such scale. Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team & potential for the future.
Sure 🌌 💫
"Look, at least it’s not the Magellanic Clouds. They’re basically next door."
"Just between us, I have a teleportation stargate to the Andromeda galaxy. It’s amazing."
So true
The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued & water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
Sounds good
Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
It will happen for sure. Damn.
Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. Wonder why.
"Damn, now I want donuts 🍩"
Yeah
Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
"You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues & hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."

"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm & ppb test results & will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I’m in China so that won’t be working until tomorrow."
Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.

Stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome
Good point
"Definitely. Can’t wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
Well  it looked smaller on paper
"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big"
"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump & generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
Makes a lot of sense
This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
Please lmk results of your water tests
"When you’re there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
Exactly
"No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers & supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"

"Ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue & denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science & engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry & at std air pressure entire time."
"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review & discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey & demonstrate at any time."
"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
Ok
Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts & named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
"Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
Tube diameter is 31cm
"Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."

"Ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue & denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science & engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry & at std air pressure entire time."
"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review & discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey & demonstrate at any time."
"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
Ok
Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts & named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
"Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
Tube diameter is 31cm
"Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."

"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz
It is both alarming & explanatory that you run a psych ward
"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio & phone/music player."
"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
"Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand"
"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front & rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure."
I am an engineer
Tight control code is always C
Python is done right. Great name story too.
"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"
🖤🖤🖤 Python 🖤🖤🖤
Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.

"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."

Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.
Yes
Yes
Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights & adjust bouyancy.
Yes
"4 handles/hitch points on front & 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front & 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
Ground winds would
Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
Can’t be too buoyant
"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
Good idea
"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."
You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
"Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.

It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
I would def recommend this
Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
Interesting
"Great, thanks"
Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won’t come in"
"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.

Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
.@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos & Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective
"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette & supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
True
"So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
".@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
What a coincidence
Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
"Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
"Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings & extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
"Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him & he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
"has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &3 production number, which is physically impossible."
"Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production & followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 & @Reuters."
".@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
".@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

True

"“ of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”"
"“All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”"

"As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death & hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe & open to all."
"This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla."

"Humanity is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got"
"Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old & sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn’t have happened at all."

Life is good
"It is unknown whether we are the only civilization currently alive in the observable universe, but any chance that we are is added impetus for extending life beyond Earth"
This is why we must preserve the light of consciousness by becoming a spacefaring civilization & extending life to other planets
So strange

It’s real

I was dying to use the word sus
Working in the factory
Expanding the tour soon. So many cool things to see. Tesla car factory has 3rd largest footprint of any building on Earth. Maybe 1st if you include all our sweet tents ⛺️😜
Looks so sus when we paint cars red
Which rolls out today
Will be there in next release
So big you can’t believe it

"Infinity Work, the Reality game"
"That would be tricky to sequence, but maybe"
Was thinking of offering an extended Tesla factory tour option where you could help build part of a car & understand how they come together. I know it would have been super fun for me when I was a kid (or now).
It’s called Top Secret
Yes
"When I was a kid, I built model airplanes, trainsets, rockets (mixed my own powder), explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers), a radio, lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college."
"Yeah, but I’m not sure what the big deal is. I like building things. If that ends up being useful work too, even better."
We will add a config to lower the alert
Apply light force to the steering wheel. Alert is being changed to this text.

Try saying “bug report”. Might work better. Ironic if the bug report about bug reports isn’t working :)
"Thanks for the feedback, will investigate"
Sure
Congratulations!
It’s actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people & good for environment. I think that’s fundamental goodness.
"Btw, if anyone else wants to build this tunnel, please do so. It’s a lot of work."

Thanks for coming by our car factory with @westcoastbill. Tesla team was super fired up to see you! Congrats on your victory!!
"Crazy, that was over 22 years ago. Thanks for believing in us!"
"There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That’s still ~40 people."
Today. It’s kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn’t change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.
Because honey is a vegetable
Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
"Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high."

"He’s obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak & a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."
Great name. A little on the nose.
"That’s really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what “money” is."
"Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced & above 50% too negatively affects economic output."
Cool video
Thank you for helping those in need
"To be clear, Tesla European Headquarters will remain in Netherlands"
Yup

"Just because I donate doesn’t mean I support every last thing a person or organization does, but I like all the people I’ve met from @ACLU. They really care about doing good."
I am one of the top donors to @ACLU
"I couldn’t even keep the US in the Paris Accord, but if there is some way for me to help these kids I will do so"
I think so
I hope the kids are ok
Shelter
You’re probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down.
I’m at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. It’s big.
They look beautiful
Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
It’s actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable & a great view of the mountains.
Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga & spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
They also poured the concrete & built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
No
"Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much ♥️🚘💫"
"You’re welcome, bad fiction writer 78"
"Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow & nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can’t even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer."

You won’t find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.

They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I’m driving.
Can’t wait for the new @RickandMorty season to start!
"We’ve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union & Tesla stock. Also, free drinks & snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla & me via 3rd parties."
Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
"Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show."
"I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) & other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America."
They started it & attacked me personally
Search UAW and “corruption”. Very long reading list. Great organization.
“Profit” just means you earned more money than you spent & certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing & extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years & we’re almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford & Tesla has gone bankrupt.
They don’t seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
Engels wrote 2nd & 3rd volumes based on Marx’s “notes”. Less reliable.
"Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware."
"Wow, you know nothing & are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change & you couldn’t care less."
"Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?"
Iron pyrite
Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!
"You’re just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I’d fail & be back in 3 months."

You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position.
Well said
Then you’ll be fine
Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
"...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate."
"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
How big is your short position? Just curious.
Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
"UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps."
"I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."
"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
"Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
"Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through & through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case."
"SX 300 & soon SX 500. Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine."
"Structures, engines, avionics, guidance & control software, new alloys, space lasers (ooh, maybe I shouldn’t have said that)"
Love you too 💕

"Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness."
That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.

"Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good."
Might actually be his!
Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in 3 weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of 1st Model 3 dual motor performance coming off the line
You’re a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.
Yes
Sigh
"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."
"“No sense of humor” is certainly proving itself true. Good grief!
How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? 
Answer: That’s not funny!!"

The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape & size of those streams.
Strongly disagree. I love humanity.
"Already did. Meant to go longer, but ran out of time."
I always wanted to do a terms & conditions cover of Green Eggs & Ham
Foundation Series & Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX
I love Banks. Best books in recent years imo are Iain Banks & George Martin.
"Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon"
Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. It’s pretty simple & mostly influenced by Douglas Adams & Isaac Asimov.
My donations are anonymous
Already sold >$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about 20 years when Tesla is steady state.
"My “pay” is in options, which only matter if stock goes up & I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education & environment on Earth w my foundation. Just don’t want us to be sad about the future."
Dankonia
We use less than 3% cobalt in our batteries & will use none in next gen
"Yes, interface will change with Version 9 software"
"Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean “slight up or downward force on the wheel”, not really “hold the wheel”"
"Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly."
"Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered:"
That is actual footage

"Of course, but it’s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet & anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing & we’re never going to make them again."
"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof."
Not recommended for urban environments
Yes
"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
Love this design. Simpler the better.

"Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
"Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
Will do
"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) & O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another."
"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
"This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine & no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔"

Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter"
And we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form"
Running track in @SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this
"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S & X w HW2 Autopilot & all Model 3 cars."
Working on improving
"No way 6 mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, 7 mins is obv right."
"Oh please, that’s obv overkill"
Tip of the day
Coming soon
"We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though, not 2 years."
Congratulations @murraymatt. Good move by @WSJ. Please use Matt’s Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor
"Yup, we are extending the net area by a factor of 4"
"Am def not under any illusion that this will end illiteracy, but I hope it helps at least a little"
"Good morning, Sonic. Not sure how to break it to you, but"
"We have about 11,000 projects underway in Puerto Rico"
Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team

"Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won’t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s.
Next year

"Usually, they don’t even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so."
Actually true!
"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
"But don’t worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels & everything’s just fine"
"Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
Glad you’re ok!

That sounds like a fun adventure!
You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel & it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
"Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little 🥜 on S/X."
"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen & particulate of almost any kind"
"Model S & X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter & a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3."
"Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus"
Do it

Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.

You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading & point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair & accurate in their criticism."
"Ride comfort & aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
Prob 8.3
Yes
"All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say “bug report” followed by issue description."
“Pneumatic” means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
"Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort."
"Yeah, absolutely"
Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise & ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.
Like you guys too 🚘 🖤
"Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube & each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."
"Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should."
Good progress. Really proud of this design & SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.

"“Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science & I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up."
"You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
Great book. Read it when it came out.
Exactly
SpaceX has Area 58 at Cape Canaveral. That’s 7 better than 51.
Yeah
Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
Yes
"There are no aliens. Officially, at least"
You have so many great pics & factoids!
"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions & not lose money."
I really want to make this cupholder
"A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size & stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp & dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice."
I’ve literally had dreams about cup holder designs
Noted. We can prob adjust spring force & catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
You’re welcome. Appreciate the letter.
Good school

"Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” & my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media."
Thanks 😀

Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
"Pointing out to aspiring journo & Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
You’re right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off
Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
You’re missing the point & living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election & only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll
"You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
"Yup, deleted"
? It should
"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking & will ride tire traction limit. You won’t notice sport brakes unless you’re on a racetrack & have the sticky 20” tires."
"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks @ConsumerReports for excellent critical feedback!"
"Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers & sport level brakes"
Keyword “future” 🤣

Will do another rev before final design

That’s what I had in mind
Sometimes even I think we’re the same person!
"Nanotech *is* bs imo. When you take something that has nothing to do w gender & make it about that, you devalue genuine gender issues."
"About to ship. @BoringCompany holding flamethrower pickup parties in a week or so, then deliveries begin. Check   for details."
It’s not
That’s a great song!
"Sometimes  when I have hurt feelings, I play this song"
"No, that’s the other guy @BoredElonMusk"
So true 😢
Because Twitter is fun
USAToday FTW!
Dank is wack unless you’re on weed
"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this “non-journalist” who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
But femtotech is the future
Nanotech is so 2008. Picotech is 1000 times better.
"Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."

The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
Well said. NYT journo is outraged that “dumb” public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.
"Pretty good. TinTin A & B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."
"It’s cool for kids & if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a “rocket scientist” in aerospace, they would think you’re 🙃"
I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away & our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause
Does the psych ward know you smuggled in a mobile phone?
The pain will end
"Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening"
Gwynne has been prez of SpaceX for 10 years & well-deserved
"Stop trying to charm me. It won’t work. Ok, maybe a little 😊 Are you a real person or a bot?"
"Using “rocket science” non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on 🚀🔬"
What are you talking about? You’re being incredibly rude & nonsensical.
"Wow, haven’t watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
Can’t believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
"We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"
Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
Prob end of next year
"Good point, we will add that to the construction plan"

"Earth’s rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
You’re making my point. It’s tragic that there’s a national nano day. I wish I didn’t know that.
All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
Model 3 was designed for min engineering & tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe & Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year & is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."
Worth a shot
Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire”
"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
"Problem solved, was able to buy  ! Game on"
"I know, I know. Russia seriously didn’t correct me on this!"
"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd"
"Turns out   is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me"
"For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me"
"Tried to buy  , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
"Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles & know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. ♥️ Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest & yet believe that same public is too stupid & immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
The Tesla facility is open plan & we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well & they are some of the worst & best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.

No
Nano applies to everything & therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.
"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
"Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
Done
Have a confirmed real name identity section & an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
Be careful what you wish for
"Amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll🤔"
My point exactly
"Ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs."
Reddit is great
"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
I did to any who asked
"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
"Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like & what needs to be improved"
"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right."
"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
Gasoline or diesel?

The media
"Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “You’re Right!”  I do actually own  , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
Definitely
"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these 🚗 🚙 and this is the best one 🚘"
Yo
That’s the basic idea
"For some reason, this is the best I’ve felt in a while. Hope you’re feeling good too 🚀♥️🌏"
"I just tried to donate, but you don’t accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
Thank you! I thought it was so obvious
Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
"Yeah, I think you do great work"
"If you’re in media & don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it"
🤗
"I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
Of course
"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company."

Will do
Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
That’s why editors are included too
We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
"Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek & unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
Exactly
"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda"
An exception that proves the rule
"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
"Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis & Oblivion"

"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so I’m glad there’s some good too ♥️🎼🐇. Her music is incredible."
Thanks. Not super fun right now 😔
Busted 👻
"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together & messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics & backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
Great idea!
Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
Interesting he stops at ‘09. That’s when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
"But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote & find out."
"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
Good point
"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class “lords & commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
"More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article"

"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so I’m glad there’s some good too ♥️🎼🐇. Her music is incredible."
Thanks. Not super fun right now 😔
Busted 👻
"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together & messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics & backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
Great idea!
Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
Interesting he stops at ‘09. That’s when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
"But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote & find out."
"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
Good point
"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class “lords & commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
"More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article"
No problem

I didn’t meet with him
I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production."
ABS calibration algorithm
"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
"Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️"
"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this."
"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
♥️🦄
"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."

Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal."
We’re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak & pinpoint origin by acoustic signature & triangulation
SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to @NASA Plum Brook vacuum chamber
For sure before snowfall this year
It can tow far more than rated capacity
Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun & shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
"Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union."
"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
Yes
Exactly
They can form a union whenever they want & there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
"They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell"
Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."

Good idea ...
That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
"It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
I’m about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black & white interior."
"AC induction front & switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output & get double the burn-in."
Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive & performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
Check out  . Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
But The Boring Company is right behind you at 1/15th your speed & soon will be 1/10th! Start sweating
He taunts us with his speed

Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever
Excited for @boringcompany partnership with LA Metro
lol
Listening to REALiTi
"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
Yes
Will be presenting & taking questions  about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at 7pm on Thursday
Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground & ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins
"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
Yes
"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.
"Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
