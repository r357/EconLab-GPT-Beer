"Bill Barr should have resigned a long time ago. 

We need an Attorney General whose loyalty lies with our Constitution—not with the president."
"We won’t be able to rebuild our economy if our country’s already inadequate child care system collapses during this pandemic. 

Child care is critical infrastructure—it’s past time we started acting like it."
"Everyone's watching the top of the ticket—and rightfully so. Donald Trump is a threat to our rights, values, and democracy. But change must also grow from the ground up.

Read up on the amazing local candidates I've endorsed, and sign up to help them win:"
"You ran a strong campaign that inspired many, @JoeKennedy. I know your righteous fights are far from over."
"Congratulations, @EdMarkey! I’m excited to continue fighting alongside you in the Senate, where we need your bold leadership more than ever."
"You can help protect our democracy and make sure our elections run smoothly as a paid poll worker or election judge, and it's easy to sign up.

Many who feel safe doing so are stepping up to serve for the first time—join them!"
"By electing Democrats up and down the ballot, we have a chance to choose compassion over cruelty, empathy over ego, facts over fear, and hope over hate.

Not just in the White House, but in the halls of Congress, in state legislatures, and in local offices across the country."
"As the daughter of an ironworker, @LoriTrahanMA knows how important it is to fight for working families. We can count on her to keep working for good jobs, strong unions, health care, Social Security, and to make sure everyone gets a fighting chance at the American dream."
".@AyannaPressley is a dear friend and partner in the fight for racial and economic justice. She's worked tirelessly for those who have been left out and left behind, and her bold, principled leadership is more important than ever. Her voice is truly indispensable in Congress."
".@EdMarkey knows firsthand the needs of working-class families and has been a champion for them in the Senate. And as an author of the #GreenNewDeal, he's fighting for clean energy jobs and environmental justice. It's been an honor to support my friend and partner in the Senate."
"It’s Election Day in Massachusetts, and I couldn’t be prouder of these bold leaders—partners in the fight for big, structural change in our state and across the country.

If you haven't already, I hope you'll get out there and safely vote for them today:"
"Democrats have been hard at work organizing and raising money and getting the word out about critical downballot races.

If it makes sense for you right now, can you make a contribution to help us elect Democrats up and down the ballot this November?"
"Donald Trump’s response to this pandemic has been a policy failure, a leadership failure, and a moral failure—all of historic proportions."
"As we fight this global pandemic and economic recession, we can’t ignore the ever-growing threat of climate change.

All three challenges have disproportionately affected Black and Brown communities. And we’re running out of time to act."
"If you're able to donate, please consider chipping in whatever you can. Every contribution helps fuel our fight to elect candidates who will address the deep, systemic problems Donald Trump's failed presidency has magnified."
"Don’t wake up on Wednesday, November 4th, wishing you’d done more to help Democrats win.

Remind your friends to register to vote, sign up to volunteer for a local race in your community, stand up, and speak out every single day.

Stay. In. The. Fight."
"Millions out of work. Millions more trapped in cycles of poverty. Millions on the brink of losing their homes. Millions of restaurants and stores hanging by a thread. 

This crisis is bad—and didn’t have to be this way. This is on Donald Trump and the Republicans who enable him."
"I almost quit my first big teaching job because I didn't have child care. Then my Aunt Bee showed up with seven suitcases and a Pekingese named Buddy.

Nobody makes it on their own. Yet two generations later, if you have a baby but no Aunt Bee, you ARE on your own. That's wrong."
"I’m heartsick to hear about Chadwick Boseman. Bruce and I send love to his family, friends, and fans."
"Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream lives on—but it requires all of us to carry it forward, and to fight back against the forces of hate that try to destroy it."
We can start by passing @KamalaHarris and @CoryBooker's anti-lynching legislation to make lynching a federal crime for the first time in our history.
Emmett Till's murder is one of the worst moments in our history. But let's be clear: The racism and violence that shrouds his story still exist today. We have to keep fighting until we've dismantled systemic racism and white supremacy in every aspect of our economy and society.
"A global pandemic.
Rampant climate disasters.
Devastating recession.
Police brutality.
White supremacist violence.

This is what Donald Trump and Republicans have spent the past week ignoring, denying—even defending. There aren't words sufficient for what's at stake in November."
"Climate change isn’t some far-off threat—it’s here now, leading to the extreme fires ravaging California and storms flooding Louisiana and Texas. People are dying and homes are being destroyed. If we don’t act now these disasters will just become more dangerous and more frequent."
The difference between the way Jacob Blake and Kyle Rittenhouse have been treated speaks volumes about how deeply embedded racism and white supremacy are in every aspect of our society.
"This administration has put politics over people from the start—and their failure to lead has cost thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and immeasurable damage to public trust in government. I'm calling for an investigation into Donald Trump's politicization of this pandemic."
"Holding everyone impacted by #HurricaneLaura in my heart today. Those in the path of the storm should follow local guidance to stay safe as the storm develops. 

And Congress should be prepared to provide whatever aid is necessary to ensure a safe and equitable recovery."
"It’s not enough just to say the words “Black lives matter.” We have to make it true—by ending systemic racism and dismantling white supremacy in our institutions, our systems, and in every aspect of our society."
"This #WomensEqualityDay is bittersweet, as our nation faces down a pandemic and economic crisis that’s disproportionately impacting women—especially women of color—while an administration steeped in misogyny and racism looks the other way. We've got work to do."
"Let's be clear about what we're going to see at the Republican National Convention: a parade of so-called “leaders” who have stood at Donald Trump's side as he’s ignored science, fanned the flames of racism, shoveled trillions to giant corporations, and employed fascist tactics."
I spent some time with @Bustle talking about the fight to #SaveThePostOffice and why Congress needs to hold Louis DeJoy and Donald Trump accountable for the damage they’ve done. I’m ready to give this fight all I’ve got.
".@JDScholten will stand up to the unchecked corporate power that’s taking advantage of our farmers, workers, and consumers just to maximize their own profits. I’m proud to support his efforts to level the playing field for working-class families and revitalize rural communities."
".@Dana_Balter’s values and plans have been shaped by her own experiences, and she’s committed to serving the people of her district—not special interests. I look forward to partnering with her in Congress."
"Michigan’s working families deserve a leader who will fight to make this country work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. @JonHoadley is that leader. I hope you’ll join me in supporting his campaign."
"In the middle of a pandemic, it's clear we need strong leaders like @GilCisnerosCA in Congress. Gil is fighting hard to ensure our frontline health care and public safety workers have the PPE they need to stay safe. I'm happy to support Gil in California's 39th District."
"I’m excited to endorse @Axne4Congress’s run for reelection. Now more than ever, we need leaders who put people first. Cindy has proven to be a fierce advocate for Iowa families, and we need Cindy's voice in the House. I’m with her in this fight—and the many fights to come."
".@QasimRashid has dedicated his entire career to the fight for social, racial, and economic justice. He has demonstrated the leadership and compassion the people of Virginia deserve. That's why I’m proud to endorse Qasim in his effort to flip Virginia’s First District."
".@AngieCraigMN is a fierce advocate for working families, fighting tirelessly to build a 21st century workforce and create an economy that works for everyone. I’m honored to join Angie in that fight, and proud to fight alongside her to get the job done for the Second District."
"Today, I’m proud to endorse another slate of candidates across the country who are ready to fight for bold reforms and put people first, not special interests. Take a look at the candidates below and join us in the fight:"
"Republicans haven’t just enabled Donald Trump's erosion of our values and democracy, they've actively participated in it. We don't need a Republican National Convention to show us who they are—they've shown us every day for the last four years."
We can start by passing @KamalaHarris and @CoryBooker's anti-lynching legislation to make lynching a federal crime for the first time in our history.

Louis DeJoy and Donald Trump’s sabotage of the Postal Service is a threat to our democracy. We've got to keep up the pressure—join one of hundreds of #SaveThePostOffice actions across the country tomorrow:
Police in Kenosha shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back. His children were watching. I'm holding them all in my heart today and hoping for a full recovery. Police brutality is a daily threat to Black lives. We must demand accountability.
"Donald Trump’s ignorance and incompetence have always put our country in grave danger. COVID-19 was his biggest test yet—and he failed miserably. This crisis requires real leadership, and @KamalaHarris and @JoeBiden will be the leaders we need."
"Donald Trump is the most anti-science and anti-environment president our nation has ever known. It’s destroying our climate and destroying our communities.

The climate crisis is an existential threat—and we can’t afford four more years of denial and sabotage."
"Pick any issue you care about and it’s on the line in November—from the climate crisis to child care to protecting the very foundations of our democracy. 

Tell me what issues will be on your mind when you cast your ballot:"
"It’s simple: More Americans than ever are planning to vote by mail, and Donald Trump knows that if their voices are heard, he’ll lose. We have to see the blatant attacks on our Postal Service for what they are: An attempt to silence the people and undermine our democracy."
Enough is enough: The Board of Governors must remove Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and reverse the damaging policies he’s enacted.
Donald Trump and his advisors knew exactly what they were doing. And we know exactly what we’ll be doing when we vote them out in November and hold them accountable. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Sending in my ballot for the September 1 primary in Massachusetts!
"We all need to be in the fight to get @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris elected. And after November, we all need to stay in the fight to get big things done. 

Let’s get to work:"
"People depend on the Postal Service—not only to make their voices heard during elections but also to receive life-saving medications, Social Security checks, and more. Donald Trump and his enablers are putting millions of lives at risk for political gain."
"Louis DeJoy didn't testify today before the Senate because he thought it would be fun. He did it because there has been an enormous amount of public pressure. 

We need to stay on this—for our democracy and for America."
"It's an honor to fight alongside you, @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Let’s get to work making Donald Trump a one-term president. #DemConvention"
This is our moment in history. Our moment to restore the soul of our nation. Our moment to build back our economy and our government better than ever before. #DemConvention
"Families across Iowa have been devastated by #Derecho2020, and they need help now. If you’re able to donate, please consider supporting these local resources:"
Millions of Americans rely on the Postal Service to receive prescription drugs. @Bob_Casey and I want to know if Trump and DeJoy’s efforts to degrade mail service are slowing these deliveries—and putting the people who rely on them at grave risk.
"This crisis is bad—and didn’t have to be this way. This crisis is on Donald Trump and the Republicans who enable him. On November 3, we will hold them all accountable."
"Infrastructure like roads, bridges, and communications systems keeps our economy going. It’s time to recognize that child care is also part of the basic infrastructure of this nation—it’s infrastructure for families."
"The honor was all mine, @Deb4CongressNM. 

Proud to be your partner in the many fights to come."
"Thank you, @AyannaPressley!

Aunt Bee taught me a fundamental truth: Nobody makes it on their own.

Beyond grateful to stand shoulder to shoulder with you in these fights!"

Child care should be part of the basic infrastructure of this nation—and we’ll need your leadership to get it done."
.@BarackObama is right: Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t. And the consequences of that failure are severe.
"I’m so grateful to have had the opportunity to address the #DemConvention tonight. The way I see it, big problems demand big solutions—and I’m in this fight through November and beyond to get big things done for the American people.

Watch my speech—and let’s do this together:"
"We need to elect @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. And after November, we need to stay in the fight to get big things done. So when our children and grandchildren ask what we did during this dark chapter, we can say: We organized, we persisted—and we changed America. #DemConvention"
Trump’s ignorance and incompetence have always endangered our country. COVID-19 was his biggest test—and he failed miserably. America has the most COVID-19 deaths in the world and an economic collapse—and both crises are falling hardest on Black and Brown families. #DemConvention
"One of @JoeBiden's plans that’s especially close to my heart is child care. Joe and @KamalaHarris will make high-quality child care affordable for every family, make preschool universal, and raise the wages for every child care worker. #DemConvention"
We build infrastructure like roads and bridges so that people can work. That infrastructure helps us all because it keeps our economy going. It’s time to recognize that child care is part of the basic infrastructure of this nation—it’s infrastructure for families. #DemConvention

"I love a good plan, and @JoeBiden has some really good plans. They reflect a central truth: Our economy is rigged to bail out billionaires and kick dirt in everyone else's face. But we can build a thriving economy by investing in families and fixing what’s broken. #DemConvention"
Just getting set here in Springfield. Fired up and ready for @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris!
"I’m honored to be addressing the #DemConvention tonight from the Early Childhood Education Center in Springfield, Massachusetts about an issue that’s near and dear to my heart and the backbone of the American economy: child care. 

I hope you'll tune in."
"Louis DeJoy isn't testifying before Congress because he thinks that it's going to be fun—he's doing it because of public pressure from all sides.

We can't let up on this."
"What kind of president will @JoeBiden be? Just look at his plans to invest in child care, expand social security, support our seniors, and more. He'll be a president for everyone, not just a handful of those at the top."
"DeJoy and Trump have shown us the lengths they’ll go to sabotage the Postal Service—and we can’t let them off the hook.

We must reverse the damage done, investigate DeJoy’s conflicts of interest, and fully fund the USPS. And we need to do it now."
"I’ll be addressing the #DemConvention tonight from the Springfield Early Childhood Education Center. 

A Biden administration will build real opportunity, not just for some, but for all our children."
And we’re ready to get to work to make @JoeBiden the next president of the United States. Let’s do it together:
"Looking forward to standing with you now through November. Congratulations, Pam!"
Looking forward to joining @ColbertLateShow tonight to talk with @StephenAtHome about the #DemConvention and what’s at stake in November and beyond. See you tonight!
"The #19thAmendment enshrined a woman's right to vote in the Constitution, but for too many women of color that right was denied until the Voting Rights Act was passed.

But even though we can't be together in person, I’m so looking forward to addressing the #DemConvention tomorrow—and I hope you'll tune in!"
"Our work is far from over. We've got to reverse the damage DeJoy has already done, investigate his conflicts of interest, and fully fund the USPS. He and Trump have shown us the lengths they'll go to in order to sabotage the Postal Service—and we can't let them off the hook."
"I’m honored to support @MoniqueHWorrell. Central Florida families deserve a progressive State Attorney who will end the school-to-prison pipeline and cash bail, reform our criminal justice system, and end the racist policies that have targeted so many communities of color."
Florida deserves elected officials who will show up and fight for them. @PamKeithFL is a Navy veteran who has dedicated her life to giving back to her community. Her advocacy for the people is grounded in empathy and innovative solutions. Vote for her today in the 18th district!
"Florida! You’ve got a primary election today, and I wanted to talk about two Democrats I’ve endorsed who are ready to make big, bold change. If you see them on your ballot, I hope you’ll support them. Take a look below and find out where to vote here:"
.@MichelleObama’s words at last night’s #DemConvention were powerful.
We need rapid testing for everyone. We can’t allow coronavirus testing and treatment to become yet another driver of deepening inequality.
"Americans are especially vulnerable to financial fraud and abuse during this crisis. With the Trump administration working overtime to sabotage the CFPB, states need to step up and protect consumers, too. California should stand up this agency."
"We're in a moment of crisis. But it's also a moment for change. We have a chance to choose compassion over cruelty, empathy over ego, facts over fear, hope over hate—and we can’t afford to miss it. 

Tune in tonight, and let's do this together."
"We’ve counted on the Postal Service from our very founding—and now Donald Trump wants to break it so that votes won’t be counted and he can try to claim victory when he loses in November.

We’ve got to keep up the pressure and ensure we protect the USPS."
"Donald Trump is going to do his best to raise every racist, nasty, ugly, false argument that he can against @KamalaHarris. But we’re going to be there to support her and call it out every time it happens."
"Americans understand that we face three crises right now: the coronavirus, a collapsing economy, and racial inequality—a problem that has been put off for far too long. @JoeBiden has plans not only to address what’s broken, but to build back better."
"In 2018, we took back the House. In 2020, we’re coming for the Senate, the White House, and seats up and down the ballot.

@JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris are leading that fight. But a strong grassroots movement needs everyone. If we stand together and fight together, we will win."
"Climate change isn't just a threat to our planet. It's also an economic threat that could cost people their homes, jobs, and savings. That's why I’m urging the SEC to require public companies to disclose their climate-related risks."
"I’m really looking forward to your speech, Ady!"
"Facebook has achieved its power—and Mark Zuckerberg has built his wealth—by bulldozing competition, exploiting our private information, undermining our democracy, and tilting the playing field against everyone else."
"See you on Wednesday, Democrats!"
Tune in tonight!
"We asked Facebook to close the loopholes that let climate disinformation spread on their platforms. This is not it. 

The future of our planet is at stake. There’s no company too big or powerful to be held accountable for its role in the climate crisis."
"I’m in this fight with @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris all the way. But it’s not enough to win the White House—we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot to put people in positions where they can enact the big, structural changes we need. #NN20"

But even though we can't be together in person, I’m so looking forward to addressing the #DemConvention tomorrow—and I hope you'll tune in!"
"Our work is far from over. We've got to reverse the damage DeJoy has already done, investigate his conflicts of interest, and fully fund the USPS. He and Trump have shown us the lengths they'll go to in order to sabotage the Postal Service—and we can't let them off the hook."
"I’m honored to support @MoniqueHWorrell. Central Florida families deserve a progressive State Attorney who will end the school-to-prison pipeline and cash bail, reform our criminal justice system, and end the racist policies that have targeted so many communities of color."
Florida deserves elected officials who will show up and fight for them. @PamKeithFL is a Navy veteran who has dedicated her life to giving back to her community. Her advocacy for the people is grounded in empathy and innovative solutions. Vote for her today in the 18th district!
"Florida! You’ve got a primary election today, and I wanted to talk about two Democrats I’ve endorsed who are ready to make big, bold change. If you see them on your ballot, I hope you’ll support them. Take a look below and find out where to vote here:"
.@MichelleObama’s words at last night’s #DemConvention were powerful.
We need rapid testing for everyone. We can’t allow coronavirus testing and treatment to become yet another driver of deepening inequality.
"Americans are especially vulnerable to financial fraud and abuse during this crisis. With the Trump administration working overtime to sabotage the CFPB, states need to step up and protect consumers, too. California should stand up this agency."
"We're in a moment of crisis. But it's also a moment for change. We have a chance to choose compassion over cruelty, empathy over ego, facts over fear, hope over hate—and we can’t afford to miss it. 

Tune in tonight, and let's do this together."
"We’ve counted on the Postal Service from our very founding—and now Donald Trump wants to break it so that votes won’t be counted and he can try to claim victory when he loses in November.

We’ve got to keep up the pressure and ensure we protect the USPS."
"Donald Trump is going to do his best to raise every racist, nasty, ugly, false argument that he can against @KamalaHarris. But we’re going to be there to support her and call it out every time it happens."
"Americans understand that we face three crises right now: the coronavirus, a collapsing economy, and racial inequality—a problem that has been put off for far too long. @JoeBiden has plans not only to address what’s broken, but to build back better."
"In 2018, we took back the House. In 2020, we’re coming for the Senate, the White House, and seats up and down the ballot.

@JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris are leading that fight. But a strong grassroots movement needs everyone. If we stand together and fight together, we will win."
"Climate change isn't just a threat to our planet. It's also an economic threat that could cost people their homes, jobs, and savings. That's why I’m urging the SEC to require public companies to disclose their climate-related risks."
"I’m really looking forward to your speech, Ady!"
"Facebook has achieved its power—and Mark Zuckerberg has built his wealth—by bulldozing competition, exploiting our private information, undermining our democracy, and tilting the playing field against everyone else."
"See you on Wednesday, Democrats!"
Tune in tonight!
"We asked Facebook to close the loopholes that let climate disinformation spread on their platforms. This is not it. 

The future of our planet is at stake. There’s no company too big or powerful to be held accountable for its role in the climate crisis."
"I’m in this fight with @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris all the way. But it’s not enough to win the White House—we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot to put people in positions where they can enact the big, structural changes we need. #NN20"
"Earlier this week, I called on the Inspector General to investigate the disruptive changes made to the Postal Service under Louis DeJoy. Now, that review is happening—and we must keep up the pressure until we get answers."
"Congratulations, @ChrissyTeigen and @JohnLegend!"
"As we celebrate the 85th anniversary of the Social Security Act, I’m thinking about the woman who fought to make it happen—because she knew that “the role of government should be to give all the people under its jurisdiction the best possible life.”"
We have to see the blatant attacks on our Postal Service from Donald Trump and Louis DeJoy for what they are: An attempt to silence the people and undermine our democracy.
"The Trump administration’s haphazard approach to this crisis has put lives at risk, time and time again."
"The fight to protect vote-by-mail isn’t about politics. It’s about our democracy.

And we’re ready to give it all we’ve got."
"Black women are more likely to be their families’ sole breadwinners, yet they’re paid less and face a steeper climb to provide that financial security. This pandemic is making those disparities even worse—and we need to address it head-on."
"Donald Trump knows that if the people are heard in November, he and Republicans up and down the ballot will lose. 

This is what we’re up against—and this is why we have to fight back with all we’ve got."
"I'll do everything I can to ensure @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris win—but I’ll need your help. 

You—the grassroots movement for big, structural change—are essential in this fight. If you're able, make a donation to their campaign. Let's win this together."
The problems we face are huge—and they don’t end with the man in the White House. We need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot willing to fight for the structural change we need. Learn about the candidates I've endorsed and commit to helping them win:
It didn’t have to be this bad. The Trump administration could have acted swiftly to mitigate the spread of this virus—yet they choose to spread misinformation to cover up their egregious lack of leadership.
Your voice has been critical in the fight to put power in the hands of the people and protect basic human rights. I’m proud to stand alongside you in the many fights to come!
"America is crying out for leadership, and what has Donald Trump done? Ignored science, fanned the flames of racism, and employed tactics from the playbook of fascists and dictators. Electing @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris isn't just an electoral imperative—it's a moral obligation."
".@KamalaHarris will be a great partner to @JoeBiden in making our government a powerful force for good in the fight for social, racial, and economic justice."
"Even in the midst of a global pandemic, Donald Trump and his administration have prioritized the needs of the wealthy and well-connected—and everyone else is paying the price."
Louis DeJoy and Donald Trump could have a stake in the decline of the Postal Service. That’s why I’ve asked the Inspector General—an independent watchdog—to investigate the dangerous changes that have been put in place under the new Postmaster General.
"It’s Election Day, Minnesota—and I hope you'll vote for @IlhanMN. Every day, Ilhan fights from the heart to put power in the hands of the people. Her voice is needed in Congress now more than ever. Find your polling place and vote today:"
"It's Election Day, Connecticut! @JahanaHayesCT has been a force in Congress who gets that education and child care are the backbone of our country—and has the experience and passion to fix what’s broken. I'm proud to support her and hope you will, too:"
"Here’s how, in a matter of months, Donald Trump has undermined and corrupted our most popular government agency—the Postal Service—and what I’m doing about it."
"The rights of millions of Americans are on borrowed time because Donald Trump and Republicans have hijacked our courts and changed the face of the judicial system. 

Justice is on the line in November."

This will happen more if we cram students back in school buildings without the proper resources or distancing practices. We’re putting our educators and students at great risk. It’s unacceptable.
Maternal mortality is a crisis in our country—especially for Black and Native people. This pandemic is putting expecting mothers at an even higher risk. I’m proud to be @LaurenUnderwood’s partner in the fight to address this crisis head-on.
"46 years ago, Richard Nixon resigned. In 1974, Democrats and Republicans united behind impeachment not out of mutual contempt for Nixon, but mutual respect for the rule of law.

Congress failed to do the same for Donald Trump. But on November 3, we can act—by voting him out."
Mark Zuckerberg should listen to his employees and explain what the company will do if Donald Trump uses its platform to try to undermine the results of the presidential election.

None of this will be easy.

But you don’t get what you don’t fight for."
"Private equity is gearing up to run the same playbook they ran during the 2008 financial crisis—and we all know what happened then.

The good news is that we know how to keep this from happening. Now we just have to have the courage to do it."
"Donald Trump and Republicans are afraid of young people making their voices heard. 

And they should be—it means they’re going to lose."
"This is the clearest example yet of Trump and his puppet Postmaster General's attempts to sabotage the USPS before November's election.

This kind of behavior is why we're demanding an investigation into Trump’s USPS—the Inspector General should add this to their list."
"Today I’m endorsing my colleague @IlhanMN in her re-election campaign. From tackling the climate crisis to putting power in the hands of the people, Ilhan is a partner in the fight for big structural change."
"I've had it with Donald Trump's cronies undermining the agencies they're supposed to serve.

My colleagues and I are calling on the Inspector General to investigate the policy changes Louis DeJoy has instituted—and potential conflicts of interest."
"Families see a looming catastrophe. Private equity firms just see dollar signs.

@carroll_fife and I have a plan to guard against the coming wave of evictions—and prevent predatory companies from further destabilizing communities."
The Trump administration has botched the response to this pandemic—and we’re all paying the price for their catastrophic incompetence.
"I’ll say it again: We can’t fix our economy without first containing this virus. 

We know what we need to do. It’s past time to act."
"Keeping our child care system afloat is key to our economic recovery. If we don't support our child care centers and treat them like the critical infrastructure they are, millions of parents won’t be able to go back to work—even when it's safe to do so."
"It's been two weeks since the eviction moratorium expired. One week without expanded unemployment insurance. 

Families need real relief now. Trump and his Republican enablers need to put the needs of the people before the pocketbooks of their corporate buddies."
"Congratulations, Gabby! It’s been an honor to support your campaign, and I’ll be right by your side all the way to November—and beyond."

"As a consensus builder and community advocate, @Brandon4Tenn has proven he'll fight for health care, criminal justice reform, and an economy that works for everyone. I'm excited to stand with him in this fight to win State House District 49, and in the many fights to come."
"I'm excited to support @GabbySalinas—a cancer survivor, scientist, and health care advocate dedicated to bold, inclusive reform for State House District 97. She has an incredible story of survival and resilience, and she's running to care for the community that took care of her."

I’m glad to see that Missourians voted to expand Medicaid, ensuring that thousands more people will get the life-saving medical care they need. We will keep fighting until that's true for everyone."

"I hope St. Louis will re-elect @VoteGardner2020 as Circuit Attorney. Kim won’t back down in the fight for social, racial, and economic justice. She's fought to address the root causes of crime and has been a leader in police accountability and rolling back mass incarceration."
I know that @HillaryScholten will make real and lasting change for the people of West Michigan. She's a civil rights attorney fighting every day to make her neighbors' lives a little bit better—and I can't wait to help continue those fights arm in arm with her in Congress.

"Our mayors are on the front lines every day for our cities, and we need that knowledge and strength in Congress now more than ever. As Mayor of Topeka, @Dasharyl has been fighting for her family, for her community, and for her city—and now, she wants to fight for her state."
"Real change starts at the local level—and that's why Arizonans should be sure to send former Teacher of the Year @ChristinePMarsh to the State Senate. She knows firsthand what it's like to teach in Arizona's public schools, and she’ll fight for students and educators."

We need to make sure schools have all the resources they need to determine whether and how to safely reopen—or we risk recklessly endangering more lives."
"Donald Trump and his partisan cheerleader of a Postmaster General are trying to undermine the postal service. 

Congress must shore up the USPS so everyone can continue to receive the essential supplies they need, and so as many Americans as possible can safely vote from home."
"I am proud to stand with @PramilaJayapal today, in November, and in the many fights to come. From taking on corruption, to standing up to racism and xenophobia, to protecting workers' rights, Pramila is a progressive champion that our country can always depend on."
"We need proven progressive leaders in Congress to call out corruption and stand up for the people. From taking on special interests in the coal, oil, and the chemical industries to standing up to the wealthy and well-connected, @BethDoglio has shown she’s one of those leaders."
"As City Treasurer, @Tishaura has been laser focused on serving working families in St. Louis and has been on the front lines of the fight to reduce the racial wealth gap. I’m proud to support her re-election and know she'll continue to improve the lives of the people she serves."
.@NicoleRGalloway has spent her career taking on corrupt politicians and special interests—and winning. I’m proud to support her because I know she’ll do the same as Missouri's next governor. Missouri deserves a leader who fights for working families—not the special interests.
"After working as a teacher, then building a career helping small businesses grow, @JillSchupp first got into politics as a mom fighting for public schools. And during her time in the state legislature, she's proven she's the leader Missourians need. Let's send her to Congress!"
"I hope St. Louis will re-elect @VoteGardner2020 as Circuit Attorney. Kim won’t back down in the fight for social, racial, and economic justice. She's fought to address the root causes of crime and has been a leader in police accountability and rolling back mass incarceration."
I know that @HillaryScholten will make real and lasting change for the people of West Michigan. She's a civil rights attorney fighting every day to make her neighbors' lives a little bit better—and I can't wait to help continue those fights arm in arm with her in Congress.
"We need tenacious fighters like @lpohutsky19 in our state legislatures to make big, structural change. During her first term, Laurie championed working families, fought relentlessly to protect seniors, and worked to make health care affordable for every Michigander."
"As a single mother of five, fourth generation Detroiter, and housing organizer, @Roslyn4StateRep understands the needs of Michigan’s 9th House District—especially during this moment of crisis—and I know that she will be a powerful advocate for all working families."
".@Andy_Levin is an incredible partner in the fight for big, structural change. From his leadership on labor law reform, education equity, and green infrastructure to his work to give families a fighting chance during this crisis, Andy is an indispensable champion for the people."
"I'm proud to support my friend and colleague @GaryPeters in his run for re-election. From our work together to pass critical financial reforms to our shared fight to lower prescription drug costs, I’ve seen firsthand just how dedicated he is to putting working families first."
"Kansas deserves progressive fighters—and that’s exactly who @RuiXuKS is. I’m proud to support his re-election to the Kansas House. Rui will stand up for the vulnerable, fight climate change, and make sure Kansas never returns to the days of Sam Brownback."
"Let's send @ShariceDavids back to the House—where her voice is needed more than ever. She’s been a champion for working families in her first term, fighting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, root out corruption, and end the epidemic of gun violence in this country."
"Our mayors are on the front lines every day for our cities, and we need that knowledge and strength in Congress now more than ever. As Mayor of Topeka, @Dasharyl has been fighting for her family, for her community, and for her city—and now, she wants to fight for her state."
"Real change starts at the local level—and that's why Arizonans should be sure to send former Teacher of the Year @ChristinePMarsh to the State Senate. She knows firsthand what it's like to teach in Arizona's public schools, and she’ll fight for students and educators."
"Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and Washington—it’s Election Day, and there are some incredible Democrats on today’s ballots that need your support. 

Read up on them below, and be sure to get out there today (safely) and make your voice heard:"
"Donald Trump, his incompetent administration, and Republican inaction have made the United States an international laughingstock. 

It’s clear that they don’t have what it takes to lead our country."
"Donald Trump has not failed on his own.

Mitch McConnell and Republicans have been right by his side since he was sworn in—enabling his corruption, emboldening his ego, and eroding our democracy.

We have to hold them all accountable in November."
"In times of crisis, government can be a powerful force for good—but only if those in power are willing to put people before politics and do their jobs."
The development of a coronavirus vaccine should put public safety before politics.
"Today, I’ll be talking with my friend @JulianCastro and some amazing local candidates who are ready to fight for criminal justice reform and make real change in their communities. 

Register here and I hope I’ll see you all tonight!"
"A year ago today, El Paso was shaken by one of the largest domestic terrorist attacks against the Latinx community. We have to honor them with action by ending white supremacy and tackling our country’s gun violence epidemic."
"This hearing exposed Big Tech’s anti-competitive, manipulative, and often illegal conduct, and how it’s the result of allowing these companies to amass too much power over our economy—and our democracy."
"Donald Trump and Republicans know that if people are heard, they will lose. So they’re willing to attack the very foundation of our country. 

They’re openly attacking the right to protest, the right to assemble, the right to vote. They’re openly threatening our democracy."
"Now more than ever, we need courageous, competent leadership in the White House."
Housing isn’t just an economic issue—it’s a public health issue. We must extend and expand the evictions moratorium and pass emergency rental assistance. Republicans' refusal to act is a moral failure of historic proportions.
I hope you’ll join me tomorrow for a conversation with @JulianCastro and some of our incredible endorsed candidates. We’ll discuss how elected officials must work to end police brutality and the systemic racism that pervades our criminal justice system.
"America is crying out for leadership, and Trump has failed to meet the moment. But he hasn’t failed alone. Republicans have been right by his side.

In November, Democrats have a chance to win big and get things done, and I've got three words to say about that:

I. Can’t. Wait."
"Unemployment is higher than it’s been since the Great Depression, enhanced unemployment benefits have expired, millions of Americans are facing eviction.

And Donald Trump is golfing."
"It's been clear from the start that it's not possible to fix the economy without containing the virus—yet the Trump administration never came up with a plan for even the most basic, proven tactics like testing and contract tracing."
"We know what's broken in this country and we know how to fix it. But widely popular policies are stuck—and Republican obstruction in the Senate is only getting worse. 

We won't make progress unless we face this head on: It’s past time to get rid of the filibuster."
"Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's main qualification for the job was his donation to the Trump campaign. 

We can't let Trump turn the USPS into a political pawn run by a partisan cheerleader—especially as we're staring down an election in which millions could vote by mail."
This administration’s entire coronavirus response should be investigated from top to bottom.
Let’s not mince words on this one: Americans are dead because the Trump administration wanted to use this pandemic for political gain.
"Every dollar makes a difference in the fight to defend our democracy. I hope you’ll chip in whatever you can and tune in tonight to hear me and @JoeBiden talk about what’s at stake now, in November, and beyond."
"Eid Mubarak to Muslims celebrating #EidAlAdha around the country and around the world today. Although this year’s celebrations may look and feel very different, I hope you have a happy, blessed, and peaceful holiday."
We need to make sure schools have all the resources they need to determine whether and how to safely reopen. Anything less is recklessly endangering lives for political gain.

Looking forward to chatting with my friend @JulianCastro and some excellent @TeamWarren and @TeamJulian candidates about the role elected officials must play in the fight to tackle systemic racism at every level of our criminal justice system. Join us:
"We know what we need to do to contain the virus and save lives and our economy—but Republicans refuse to invest enough in widespread testing and contact tracing.

Trump and his Republican buddies don’t have what it takes to get us out of this crisis."
"If you're able to donate, please consider chipping in whatever you can. Every contribution helps fuel our fight to elect candidates who will address the deep, systemic problems this crisis has magnified."
"Right now, child care in this country is in crisis. And it’s going to have a powerful effect on working families and our economy. So @KatherineClark and I jumped on a call to talk about our plan to fix it."
"We should ensure that our schools are equipped with the resources for our kids to succeed: educators, nurses, counselors, social workers, and mental health professionals.  

Not police officers."
"Mail delays could mean delays for mail-in ballots, essential supplies, and life-saving medications. 

Louis DeJoy is the Betsy DeVos of the Postal Service, and he’s sabotaging his own agency when its work has never been more important."
"Chip in whatever you can today, and I hope to see you there tomorrow!"
Donald Trump doesn’t have the authority to do this—but that doesn’t make what he’s doing any less dangerous. It’s clear he will stop at nothing to spread misinformation and sow division to distract from the mess he’s created. This is what we’re up against.
"“Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.” - Rep. John Lewis"
"The economy plunged at a 32.9% pace between April and June—the worst drop in our history. Yet Republicans still won’t invest in contact tracing and nationwide testing efforts needed to contain the virus.

We need real leadership to get us out of this mess."
"I'm calling on the heads of Justice, Defense, Homeland Security and Interior to not allow their departments to be turned into Trump’s own personal militia—especially in the event Trump loses the election in November and refuses to leave office peacefully."
"Democracy as we know it is on the line. 

Now is the time to raise your voices—tonight, tomorrow, the next day, and every day after that."
I want answers from all four of them.
"These companies are stomping out competition, exploiting private information, letting discrimination and racism run rampant on their platforms, and undermining our democracy. 

Tune in at 4:15 PM ET to hear me and @RashadRobinson break down today's #BigTechHearing:"
"Our intelligence agencies reported that Russia was paying the Taliban to attack U.S. service members in Afghanistan, but Trump didn't think that was important enough to raise with Putin? We need a president who won't place Moscow's interests above the safety of our troops."
"Thanks for the kind words, Kindred! Glad you’re staying active, too."
"We can’t allow this administration to use unidentified federal officers as a secret police force to terrorize people.

We need answers—and if we don't get them, I want to hear that silence. Because at a time like this, silence will be an alarm about what’s coming."
"William Barr has abused his power to protect the most corrupt president in modern history. Today was no different.

We need an Attorney General who’s loyal to the constitution, not the president. 

Barr must resign."
"The eviction moratorium expired on Friday, putting millions of families at risk of eviction—especially Black families, who have already been hit hardest by this pandemic.  

Congress must act now to extend and expand the eviction moratorium."
"Republicans are using pandemic relief as cover to shovel billions to defense contractors while providing less unemployment insurance, ignoring a looming evictions crisis, and not doing enough to aid state and local governments.

Even by their own standards, this is obscene."

"This pandemic is deepening our country's already historic levels of inequality.

Yes. We owe it to John Lewis to carry on his lifelong fight to combat discrimination and make sure voters of color can freely exercise their right to vote.

"Today marks the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Though we've made significant progress, we must keep working to fulfill its goals of equal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for all."
The next 100 days will decide what kind of country we build together. We know this won't be easy. Nothing important ever is. We don’t take on this fight because it’s easy—we take on this fight because it’s right. And I'm proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with you in it.
"That’s the America we can create if we stand together, if we fight together, if we persist together. That's the America we can build when we beat Donald Trump, elect @JoeBiden, and put Democrats in positions to make change all across the country."
"An America where a run in with law enforcement doesn’t cost someone their life because of the color of their skin. An America where every working person—regardless of who they love, their race, gender, disability, or economic background—is paid a living wage."
"We have much work ahead of us—and we will fight on because we know the America we are fighting for. An America where government is a force for good, and where decisions in Washington are made with compassion, common sense, and moral clarity."
"100 days from Election Day, our country is in crisis. The fight for social, racial, and economic justice has reached a new threshold. Coronavirus is raging out of control. Unemployment is at Great Depression levels. And Trump is unable to govern at even the most elementary level."
"COVID-19’s impact has hit communities of color hardest from the start, exposing and exacerbating racial disparities across our systems. Letting this important relief lapse will deepen these injustices.

"The Trump administration is undermining Americans’ ability to receive essential supplies and medications—and to safely vote by mail—during a global pandemic.

They are sabotaging the Postal Service when its work has never been more important."
"Emmett Till was lynched at just 14 years old. Today would have been his 79th birthday.

Black lives matter. We must keep fighting each day to dismantle the systemic racism deeply embedded in our country."
"Donald Trump has had so many bankers in his administration that Goldman Sachs could open up a new branch at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

Donald Trump isn’t going to drain the swamp. Donald Trump is the swamp."
These racist surveillance tools are an invasion of privacy and a threat to civil liberties—and have no place in our criminal justice system.
"Our next economic relief package can boost our economy from the grassroots up, put money directly in the hands of working families, and fight the racial wealth gap. 

How? By cancelling student loan debt."
"Good. We have to build an America that lives up to its highest ideals. This is a small step, but an important one."
".@VoteGardner2020 is a fearless fighter for St. Louis families, and she won’t back down in the fight for social, racial, and economic justice. Kim has been a leader in holding police accountable and rolling back mass incarceration. It’s an honor to fight alongside her."
Unemployment benefits are set to expire next week. The eviction moratorium is up. Congress can prevent this catastrophe—but we must act now.
This administration’s handling of coronavirus has been and continues to be a tragic and historic failure of leadership. The American people deserve better.
Keeping our child care system afloat is key to our economic recovery. That’s why @TinaSmithMN and I are pushing for critical funding now to stabilize the child care system—and why I support @JoeBiden’s plan to invest in child care for the long term.
"As we fight this global pandemic, we can’t ignore the growing threat of another crisis we face every minute of every day: climate change."
"We can’t reopen schools by just snapping our fingers—no matter what Betsy DeVos says.

The next legislative package should include at least $175 billion for our public schools to help them with the enormous challenges they face, like figuring out whether and how to reopen safety."
"We need to fund the robust public health measures we know will work to address this crisis: ramped-up testing, a national contact-tracing program, and supply-chain investments to resolve supply shortages. We won’t be able to keep people safe without it."
"First: Watch this. She's right.

Second: Imagine what we could get done if women didn't have to deal with things like this on top of doing their job."
"This administration has basically given up on slowing the spread of this virus—even though we know what we need to do. 

Inaction from Trump and Republicans isn’t just unacceptable—it’s deadly."
Bucks and Montgomery Counties deserve a representative ready to rebuild an economy that works for everyone. That's why I'm proud to stand with @FinelloForPA in the fight to flip PA-01 and become the first woman to represent the district in Congress.
".@HaleIndy is a lifelong Hoosier running for Congress in the heart of Mike Pence country. As a nonprofit leader and member of the Indiana General Assembly, she earned a reputation for getting things done. I know she'll continue to work hard for her community in Congress."
I’m proud to endorse @DrCameronWebb in his run for Congress. Cameron has the expertise and experience needed to tackle our health care crisis and meet the coronavirus epidemic head on. We need strong voices like his to fight for equity and justice in Washington.
"During this unprecedented time of crisis, working families need a proven progressive leader in Congress to call out corruption and stand up for the people. I’m proud to stand with @BethDoglio in this fight."

Donald Trump isn’t going to drain the swamp. Donald Trump is the swamp."
These racist surveillance tools are an invasion of privacy and a threat to civil liberties—and have no place in our criminal justice system.
"Our next economic relief package can boost our economy from the grassroots up, put money directly in the hands of working families, and fight the racial wealth gap. 

How? By cancelling student loan debt."
"Good. We have to build an America that lives up to its highest ideals. This is a small step, but an important one."
".@VoteGardner2020 is a fearless fighter for St. Louis families, and she won’t back down in the fight for social, racial, and economic justice. Kim has been a leader in holding police accountable and rolling back mass incarceration. It’s an honor to fight alongside her."
Unemployment benefits are set to expire next week. The eviction moratorium is up. Congress can prevent this catastrophe—but we must act now.
This administration’s handling of coronavirus has been and continues to be a tragic and historic failure of leadership. The American people deserve better.
Keeping our child care system afloat is key to our economic recovery. That’s why @TinaSmithMN and I are pushing for critical funding now to stabilize the child care system—and why I support @JoeBiden’s plan to invest in child care for the long term.
"As we fight this global pandemic, we can’t ignore the growing threat of another crisis we face every minute of every day: climate change."
"We can’t reopen schools by just snapping our fingers—no matter what Betsy DeVos says.

The next legislative package should include at least $175 billion for our public schools to help them with the enormous challenges they face, like figuring out whether and how to reopen safety."
"We need to fund the robust public health measures we know will work to address this crisis: ramped-up testing, a national contact-tracing program, and supply-chain investments to resolve supply shortages. We won’t be able to keep people safe without it."
"First: Watch this. She's right.

Second: Imagine what we could get done if women didn't have to deal with things like this on top of doing their job."
"This administration has basically given up on slowing the spread of this virus—even though we know what we need to do. 

Inaction from Trump and Republicans isn’t just unacceptable—it’s deadly."
Bucks and Montgomery Counties deserve a representative ready to rebuild an economy that works for everyone. That's why I'm proud to stand with @FinelloForPA in the fight to flip PA-01 and become the first woman to represent the district in Congress.
".@HaleIndy is a lifelong Hoosier running for Congress in the heart of Mike Pence country. As a nonprofit leader and member of the Indiana General Assembly, she earned a reputation for getting things done. I know she'll continue to work hard for her community in Congress."
I’m proud to endorse @DrCameronWebb in his run for Congress. Cameron has the expertise and experience needed to tackle our health care crisis and meet the coronavirus epidemic head on. We need strong voices like his to fight for equity and justice in Washington.
"During this unprecedented time of crisis, working families need a proven progressive leader in Congress to call out corruption and stand up for the people. I’m proud to stand with @BethDoglio in this fight."
".@KimGardnerSTL is a fearless fighter for St. Louis families, and she won’t back down in the fight for social, racial and economic justice. Kim has been a leader in holding police accountable and rolling back mass incarceration. It’s an honor to fight alongside her."
.@JillSchupp is a true public servant who is dedicated to the people she represents. She has proven she is the leader Missourians need fighting for them in Congress. I’m proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with her in this fight and the fights to come.
"I'm proud to endorse @SteelenChouse18's run for the North Carolina State House. As a principal, mother, and community leader, Aimy knows firsthand the struggles working families face. I know she will bring the leadership North Carolinians deserve."
"I’m proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with @SaraGideon in her run for Senate. Mainers deserve a senator who will fight to make our country work for the people, not the special interests. Sara will continue to be a champion for working families in Maine and across the country."
It’s an honor to endorse Congressman @ColinAllredTX’s run for re-election. He has been a champion for working people and Texas families—and the 32nd District deserves a leader who is committed to fighting for a government that works for everyone.
Central Florida families deserve a progressive State Attorney who will fight to end the racist systems and policies that have unfairly targeted communities of color—like the school-to-prison pipeline and cash bail. I'm proud to endorse @MoniqueHWorrell’s candidacy.
It’s going to take bold leadership across the country to get us out of the mess that Trump and Republicans have created. I’m proud to endorse another slate of inspiring leaders who are ready to fight for a better future. Take a look and join us:
"Senator Johnson needs to explain why his efforts mirror Russian propaganda. He voted to let Donald Trump get away with soliciting foreign attacks on our election process. Now, he seems to be picking up what Trump couldn’t get done."
"Republicans have spent this crisis doing what they've done for the better part of a century: Saying no. No, no, no. Republicans have always been The Party of No. 

Enough. 

We have to vote them out—and say yes to a kinder, stronger, fairer America we know we can build together."
"Congratulations, Yuh-Line! It’s been an honor to watch you lead the fight for big, structural change from the moment you set foot in Albany. Your voice is critically important to this moment—and I hope to see you standing up and speaking out for many years to come."
"The 2008 financial crisis was a toxic mix of racism, corruption, and shameless greed. And after the crash, Wall Street had the gall to take taxpayers’ hard-earned money and then spend a million dollars a day trying to kill the @CFPB. 

But we fought back."
"I’ve laid out what I’ll be fighting for as we debate relief measures for working families across the country. We must act now to contain the virus and provide the resources needed so that our economy, our schools, and our families can begin to recover."
"Those who frame the debate around this pandemic as one of health versus economics are missing the point. It’s simply not possible to fix the economy without first containing the virus.

We need a bold, ambitious legislative response."
"Donald Trump has refused to issue national stay-at-home guidelines, failed to set up a national testing operation, fumbled production of PPE, and spread misinformation at every step. 

Congress must act as this pandemic continues to spiral out of control."
You want to get this economy started again? Then parents have to know there is a safe place for their children to go. That means we need to invest in child care and we need to invest in our public schools.
"We need a bold, ambitious response that:

→ Brings the virus under control
→ Gets communities the resources they need 
→ Addresses the burdens on communities of color
→ Supports struggling families

Our constituents are counting on us. Let's do this."
Caregivers and educators are the backbone of our communities and economy. We can’t afford not to support and invest in them—during this crisis and beyond.
There’s a reason I list the @CFPB as one of my children in my bio. I’m incredibly proud of what the agency has accomplished over the past decade. There’s much work to be done—but consumers deserve to know they’ve always got someone in their corner.
".@MikeEspyMS has lived Mississippi's history, and his voice is more important than ever. He acknowledges the nation’s struggles without losing hope for the future. He's fought to keep his state and country moving forward—and he’ll keep that fight up as its next senator."
"This is exactly why we must elect @NicoleRGalloway, who’s spent her career taking on corrupt politicians to improve public schools and fighting for Missouri’s hardworking families."
".@KimGardnerSTL is a fearless fighter for St. Louis families, and she won’t back down in the fight for social, racial and economic justice. Kim has been a leader in holding police accountable and rolling back mass incarceration. It’s an honor to fight alongside her."

"Thank you for having me in this discussion @ObamaFoundation. Today, they’re looking back at Dodd-Frank, and how it helped protect working families. Follow along:"
I remember how often families were getting cheated before the 2008 crash—and how determined President @BarackObama was to put a stop to it. Stories like these were all too common then—and disproportionately affecting communities of color.
"It’s not possible to fix the economy without first containing the virus. We need a bold, ambitious legislative response as this pandemic continues to spiral out of control. 

This is about saving lives and livelihoods—and we don’t have time to waste."
"The economy works best when we invest in families. @JoeBiden’s Build Back Better platform is economically sound and meets people where they are at a human level—from creating new jobs in caregiving and education to ensuring that parents have access to safe, affordable child care."
"In just a few minutes I’ll be talking with @SRuhle about the 10th anniversary of the CFPB and the third part of @JoeBiden’s Build Back Better platform to support our caregiving economy. 

I hope you'll tune in!"
"I’ll be speaking with @BetterMarkets tomorrow on the 10-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank about how government can be a force for good—and all that’s possible when laws are designed to protect and work for the people. 

I hope you’ll tune in!"
"Glad to see more states listening to scientists, public health experts, and medical professionals. 

Wear a mask. It will save lives."
"In Portland, unidentified federal officers are operating as a secret police force to harass protestors and violate their constitutional rights—and now Trump wants to use it as an authoritarian blueprint for further violence.

We can't let that happen."
"I’m proud to support the #StrikeForBlackLives and the workers across the country demanding justice, equality, and accountability today. 

We don't get what we don't fight for—and it's going to take a fight to dismantle white supremacy at every level."
Our democracy is on the line in November.
"This is willfully endangering our kids—and entire communities—for political gain. 

Forcing schools to reopen without providing them with the resources they need to do so safely is reckless, dangerous, and the last thing we should do."
You bet I do. The climate crisis is not a matter of opinion. Facebook must immediately close the loopholes that allow climate disinformation to spread on its platform.
"Donald Trump is going to spend this election trying to convince us that people aren’t dying and the economy isn’t collapsing because of his failure to lead during this public health crisis. But they are, and it is—and we must elect @JoeBiden in November to turn this around."
"John Lewis presided over the House vote to restore the Voting Rights Act. Mitch McConnell has had that legislation sitting on his desk for 225 days. 

It’s time for Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act."
"C.T. Vivian was beaten by a Selma sheriff while registering Black Americans to vote. His leadership led to remarkable progress, but his fights—for racial justice, to end police brutality, to secure voting rights—aren't over.

We must keep fighting."
John Lewis was a giant and a moral compass. I can’t wait to see what kind of good trouble these kids get into.
"John Lewis was and will always be an American hero and champion for civil rights, who inspired us all to make good trouble in the fight for justice. 

Rest in power, Rep. John Lewis."
"We need a government that recognizes corruption is a public health risk—that acts on science, not on connections. That’s just one more reason we must elect @JoeBiden, a leader who understands that oversight is vital to democracy."
"Eric Garner should be alive today. Instead, six years later, we heard his harrowing words all over again from George Floyd: “I can’t breathe.” Last month, Eric's daughter Emerald took over my Instagram to talk about her ongoing fight for justice for her father and so many others:"
We need answers. Now.

Inaction is unacceptable—and deadly."
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Allowing the Trump administration to have control of such critical data is potentially dangerous for America and horrible for transparency.
"This is our moment to build back our economy and our government better than ever before. So when our children and our grandchildren ask what we did to end one of the worst chapters in our nation’s modern history, we can tell them we changed America. It's time to elect @JoeBiden."
The Trump administration has shown that they're willing to lie to the American people about this pandemic for political gain. Allowing them to have control of this important data is potentially dangerous for America and horrible for transparency.
"Let’s not forget that Mitch McConnell has had critical tools to help states respond to this pandemic sitting right on his desk since May—and has decided to do nothing. 

The problem is bigger than Trump and his incompetent administration."
"I’m looking forward to fighting righteous fights alongside you in the Senate, @MJHegar! On to November—let’s make it happen."

"Congratulations, @CandaceFor24! Congress needs your voice now more than ever. I’m looking forward to standing shoulder to shoulder with you all the way to November."
The Trump administration is required by law to release reports about racial disparities in our health care system. They haven't—and now coronavirus is wreaking havoc on minority communities without help from an unprepared and unwilling federal government.
Abolish the death penalty.
We’re just over 100 days away from this critical election—and there’s a lot at stake for young people especially. Looking forward to speaking with @SymoneDSanders about the importance of engaging young voters in 2020 and beyond.
"I’ve just had it. We need a Secretary of Education that’s going to work with teachers, states, and districts to develop reopening plans that actually work and are based in science. 

We need to get rid of Betsy DeVos."

"Renters will be at an extreme risk of eviction if existing protections are allowed to expire.

Congress must pass my bill to extend the eviction moratorium and @SherrodBrown's emergency rental assistance bill to help renters make their housing payments."
Sending kids back to school during a pandemic and hoping for the best is not a plan—no matter how Betsy DeVos tries to spin it. Forcing schools to reopen without the resources for them to do so safely endangers our kids.
"Under the ACA, insurers are required to cover women's essential health care services. Donald Trump is trying to take that away—all in the midst of a pandemic that has left women disproportionately vulnerable. 

Our health care is on the line this November."
"This is a great piece by @Sebelius.

Donald Trump wants to take us back to the days when insurers could deny women health coverage and charge them more just for being women."
"Public health experts agree: Forcing schools to reopen without providing them with the resources they need to do so safely is dangerous, reckless, and the last thing we should do."
I called for impeachment the day after the Mueller report came out. Donald Trump has continued to commit crimes and pardon his felon buddies because he believes he’s above the law—and every Republican who voted to acquit him enabled and owns this.
I still am.
"On our first wedding anniversary, Bruce gave me a single rose. The next year, he gave me two. Then the next year, three. And now, you can see how long we've been married (40 years today) and how happy I am about that. Happy anniversary, Bruce!"
"Republicans have championed Donald Trump's dangerous and destructive policies. They've looked the other way as he's threatened our democracy and national security. They've pretended not to see those tweets. 

It's not just Donald Trump we have to vote out in November."
Members of Congress take an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Everyone who voted to acquit Donald Trump violated that oath—and is responsible for his continued corruption and destruction of our democracy.
"Big Pharma, Big Ag, and Big Airlines are making out like bandits in this pandemic. We need to expand oversight—and I've got a bill for that. Because corruption is bad all the time—but it smells particularly rotten during a public health crisis."
"We can’t laud our doctors and nurses as heroes one day and then turn around and do nothing to combat the crisis that’s overwhelming their hospitals and ICU beds.

We need action—not empty platitudes."
This president both commits crimes and pardons guys who commit crimes for him. The future of American democracy rests on us electing @JoeBiden:
"This proposed policy throws the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of students into uncertainty, demonstrating cruel disregard for the harm it will inflict on them and our whole country. 98 of my colleagues are joining me to urge ICE to rescind it immediately."

Congress must pass my bill to extend the eviction moratorium and @SherrodBrown's emergency rental assistance bill to help renters make their housing payments."
Sending kids back to school during a pandemic and hoping for the best is not a plan—no matter how Betsy DeVos tries to spin it. Forcing schools to reopen without the resources for them to do so safely endangers our kids.
"Under the ACA, insurers are required to cover women's essential health care services. Donald Trump is trying to take that away—all in the midst of a pandemic that has left women disproportionately vulnerable. 

Our health care is on the line this November."
"This is a great piece by @Sebelius.

Donald Trump wants to take us back to the days when insurers could deny women health coverage and charge them more just for being women."
"Public health experts agree: Forcing schools to reopen without providing them with the resources they need to do so safely is dangerous, reckless, and the last thing we should do."
I called for impeachment the day after the Mueller report came out. Donald Trump has continued to commit crimes and pardon his felon buddies because he believes he’s above the law—and every Republican who voted to acquit him enabled and owns this.
I still am.
"On our first wedding anniversary, Bruce gave me a single rose. The next year, he gave me two. Then the next year, three. And now, you can see how long we've been married (40 years today) and how happy I am about that. Happy anniversary, Bruce!"
"Republicans have championed Donald Trump's dangerous and destructive policies. They've looked the other way as he's threatened our democracy and national security. They've pretended not to see those tweets. 

It's not just Donald Trump we have to vote out in November."
Members of Congress take an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Everyone who voted to acquit Donald Trump violated that oath—and is responsible for his continued corruption and destruction of our democracy.
"Big Pharma, Big Ag, and Big Airlines are making out like bandits in this pandemic. We need to expand oversight—and I've got a bill for that. Because corruption is bad all the time—but it smells particularly rotten during a public health crisis."
"We can’t laud our doctors and nurses as heroes one day and then turn around and do nothing to combat the crisis that’s overwhelming their hospitals and ICU beds.

We need action—not empty platitudes."
This president both commits crimes and pardons guys who commit crimes for him. The future of American democracy rests on us electing @JoeBiden:
"This proposed policy throws the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of students into uncertainty, demonstrating cruel disregard for the harm it will inflict on them and our whole country. 98 of my colleagues are joining me to urge ICE to rescind it immediately."
"Public school teachers are some of the strongest, hardest working, most dedicated people in our country. They deserve a partner in the White House—and with @JoeBiden and @DrBiden, they’ll get two."
China's suppression of Muslims now meets the UN definition of genocide. I unequivocally condemn this state-sponsored cruelty. The Trump administration must urgently do much more to hold China accountable.
"Trump is trying to cover up for his own corruption and for his corrupt government. @JoeBiden, on the other hand, sought out an independent Inspector General to oversee the work he did on the last bailout in the Obama administration. 

The choice in 2020 could not be clearer."
Donald Trump will spend this election trying to convince us that the economy isn’t collapsing. That everything is just fine. But he’s wrong—and his failed leadership got us here. @JoeBiden will use all of the tools of government to build our economy back better than before.
Auditor @NicoleRGalloway has spent her career taking on corrupt politicians and special interests—and winning. I am confident that as Governor of Missouri she'll do the same. I’m proud to join her in this fight.
"We need people like @KateForCongress. She’ll put working families first and fight for a government that works for everyone. She's proven herself to be the transformational leader we need during uncertainty and crisis, and I look forward to the fresh leadership she'll bring to DC."
"Representative @ErinForYall is a fighter who gets things done for working families. She has stood up for our environment, public education, and the rights of each and every Texan. I know she'll continue fighting the good fight when she's reelected."
"I'm proud to endorse @Tishaura for City Treasurer. She’s been laser focused on serving working families in St. Louis, and has been on the front lines of the fight to reduce the racial wealth gap. I know she'll continue her fight to improve the lives of the people she serves."
I’m proud to stand with @LydiaBeanTexas’s campaign for District 93 in the Texas House. Lydia has established herself as a strong leader and a voice for the voiceless in state politics. She's the right choice for this tremendous time of crisis.
".@Brandon4Tenn has proven that he will fight for health care, criminal justice reform, and an economy that works for everyone—no exceptions. He'll bring historic representation to the Tennessee General Assembly, and I'm excited to stand with him."
We've got a lot more work to do and we need @Bonnie4Congress's voice in that fight. I’m proud to call her a colleague. She’s doing tremendous work on behalf of our shared progressive values and the people she represents in New Jersey.
"Teachers get the job done. That's why I'm endorsing @PattiMinter4KY for reelection. She's been fighting for big, structural change her whole life—as an educator, an advocate, and a state representative leading the fight to protect health care, LGBTQ+ rights, and women veterans."
"As the son of immigrants and an educator, @RickyHurtadoNC brings the leadership and lived experience needed in this transformational moment. I know he’ll bring bold solutions to the table so working families can overcome this public health crisis and emerge stronger than before."
We need @CoryBooker's voice and vision more than ever. He’s helping lead the charge to end police brutality and root out systemic racism—and has forged coalitions to create progress for working families. I'm honored to endorse his campaign for reelection.
"As a small business owner and breast cancer survivor, @SimaforTX knows no one should have to choose between a life-saving medication and feeding their family. She'll take on the drug lobby and protect Texans with pre-existing conditions."
"It’s my privilege to endorse my friend and colleague @PramilaJayapal for reelection. She's a progressive champion we can depend on to fight corruption, stand up to racism and xenophobia, protect workers' rights, and expand environmental justice."
"It’s an honor to endorse @HarrisonJaime’s campaign to bring new and bold leadership into the Senate. His empathy, character and integrity make him a leader South Carolinians deserve. I’m ready to fight with him to build a better future."
"I’m honored to stand with @TimsDesiree in the fight to flip OH-10. She understands the importance of a government that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. She'll be a compassionate leader who will fight for quality jobs, education, and health care."
"Our country is in desperate need of bold leadership at every level. These candidates are stepping up for their communities and I'm proud to endorse them in these fights. Read more below, and if you’re able, chip in whatever you can to support them:"
"I’m joining @CuomoPrimeTime tonight at 9 PM ET to continue discussing @JoeBiden’s economic recovery plan, and how we can elect leadership that’s ready to build an economy that works for everyone. I hope you’ll tune in!"

"The United States has a legal and moral obligation to honor its treaties with Tribal Nations. Today, the Supreme Court rightly reaffirmed that obligation."
Big Ag corporations crush competition and harm public health while regulators look the other way. I’m joining @CoryBooker and @RoKhanna to stand up to them with legislation that will phase out giant factory farms.
"We can’t keep pretending that this outbreak is getting better. We need to face reality, give states the resources they need, set standards, and stick to them. 

If we don’t, we will never get ahead of this virus."
"This is the worst unemployment crisis since the Great Depression, and we have yet to see a concrete plan from the Trump administration. 

This crisis needs real leadership—and that’s not Donald Trump."
"We can't keep ignoring the facts and hoping our economy recovers on its own—we need action and we need leadership. 

That's what @JoeBiden will bring to the White House."
"We need to act fast and boldly if we’re going to get through this crisis. And as we do so, we must address the historic injustices that have left Latino communities at an even higher risk."
"Donald Trump was a failed president long before his botched handling of coronavirus and this economic recession. He's spread misinformation, stoked the flames of hate, and let corruption run rampant since day one. For the sake of our democracy, we have to vote him out."
Donald Trump’s pattern of retaliation against anyone who attempts to hold him accountable is the stuff of dictatorships—not democracies.
"There's an impending “eviction avalanche”—and Black people and people of color are going to be hit hardest. 

I spoke with @JulianCastro about why that is, and why it's so important for Congress to act immediately to stop it."
"We have yet to get ahead of this virus. The consequences should not be taken lightly. 

We need to listen to leaders who are developing guidelines based on science and facts—not poll numbers."
It’s clear that @AdyBarkan and @JoeBiden share the empathy we need to tackle our broken health care system—especially when it comes to the dignity of long-term care. This conversation is more critical than ever and I’m grateful to fight alongside both of them.
"Facebook’s oversight board should be doing everything in its power to prevent the mistakes of 2016 as we approach one of the most important elections of our lifetime.  

Refusing to meet this moment threatens our democracy."

Tune in!"

"This decision is a terrible reminder that we cannot let up in this fight. 

This isn’t just an attack on reproductive justice—it’s an attack on economic justice, too."
We need #JusticeForVanessaGuillen—and for the countless people like her who have experienced sexual harassment and assault in the military without enough protection or avenues for accountability.
Black and Brown communities have been hit hardest by this crisis across the board—and the impending spike in evictions will be the same unless we act. We need to extend the eviction moratorium and expand it to include more renters. I have a bill for that. Congress should pass it.
"The facts are clear: We are still fighting the coronavirus—and losing. 

Instead of continuously spreading misleading information, the Trump administration needs to get its act together and come up with a real plan to address this pandemic."
"Affordable, high-quality child care was already too hard to find before this pandemic—and now it’s more critical than ever. If we want a real and equitable economic recovery, we need a federal investment in child care."

"I’m proud of my home state for taking this fight to the ballot box and winning—and glad for the 200,000 more Oklahomans who will soon have health care."
"In the middle of an economic crisis, the Trump administration is trying to unravel the progress that was made to stabilize the mortgage market after the last recession. Adam Levitin and Susan Wachter remind us here and in their new book what's at stake."
Trump has already vowed to fill the Supreme Court with far-right ideologues who could roll back our rights and our progress for generations. We need to mobilize now to stop his takeover of our courts and create a more just America. #SupremeCourtVoter
"We need to root out white supremacy at every level.

That includes removing the symbols that honor Confederate leaders on our military bases—and ending their glorification of slavery, white supremacy, and domestic terror."
Keep fighting the good fights. Sorry I missed you!
"Today, many will be asked to pay their rent or risk eviction in the middle of a pandemic—and by the end of the month, what protections do exist for them will expire. Congress must pass my bill to extend the current evictions moratorium and expand protections to more renters."
"Other countries have contained the virus. It's possible to control the spread. The U.S. simply hasn't done what we need to do—not by a long shot. We know the solutions: contact tracing, testing, masks. But we need our leaders to act instead of burying their heads in the sand."
Yes we do—and I’ve got a bill for that.
"Bold, progressive candidates like the ones we’ve seen this cycle don’t rise on their own—they rise because they inspire their communities to stand with them, and because they put people first. 

Win or lose, they’re worth fighting for."
"Much to the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board's dismay, the CFPB is here to stay."
"Donald Trump’s advocacy of state-sponsored violence against peaceful protesters is horrific. Full stop. 

Politicians who refuse to condemn his actions share responsibility for the consequences."
"Thank you for running, @Booker4KY. You inspired so many and showed that the people of Kentucky—and the country—want big, structural change. I know your righteous fights are far from over, and I’m as proud as ever to stand with you!"
"We need leaders whose loyalty is to the people—not Trump and his delusional narratives. 

States need real relief, and they need it now."
"Donald Trump is a failed Commander-in-Chief. 

His administration knew our troops were in danger and did nothing. These service members risked their lives for our country—and he betrayed them."
"Nearly half of U.S. adults are unemployed, but the Trump administration has yet to come up with a plan for how to get us out of this crisis. 

Donald Trump and his administration are putting lives and livelihoods in danger."
"If we don’t get our act together, this is our future. Thousands more Americans will die and our economy will be brought to its knees.

We need leaders to have enough backbone to face reality, distribute resources, set standards, and stick to them."
I’ve introduced legislation with @TinaSmithMN to ensure child care centers have the resources to be safe and healthy places for our children during this pandemic and beyond—and to give child care workers the support they need.
"Lack of affordable child care was locking too many women out of the workforce before this pandemic—and now it’s more critical than ever. If we want a real and equitable economic recovery, we need a federal investment in child care—and we need it now."
"There are several recent Supreme Court decisions worth celebrating. But the rights they affirmed shouldn’t have been in question in the first place. 

We need to organize, win elections, and pass laws that ensure we’re living up to the values we claim every day."
"Mike Pence says we’ve made ""remarkable progress"" when it comes to coronavirus. Meanwhile, in the real world, we’re setting new records for cases with no end in sight. 

We know what we need to do: Masks, contact tracing, and testing. We just need the leadership to get it done."
"The Trump administration will blame everyone but themselves. 

The facts remain: Their lack of leadership during a nationwide crisis is dangerous and they need to be voted out."
American Airlines is recklessly endangering millions of lives just to make a profit. They should fully refund passengers who don’t feel safe flying with the airline—just like @EdMarkey and I urged them to do three months ago.
"America is facing a housing crisis made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Today, I’m introducing a nationwide eviction moratorium bill to extend eviction protections for one year and expand the protections to include more renters."
Looks like one brave boy to me. Tell him Bailey says hi!
"The @CFPB continues to be an independent agency. Their job is to get the tricks and traps out of credit cards, mortgages, student loans, and other financial products, and to hold big banks accountable when they cheat people. Nothing in the Supreme Court ruling changes that."
"After years of industry attacks and GOP opposition, a conservative Supreme Court recognized what we all knew: The @CFPB itself and the law that created it is constitutional. The CFPB is here to stay."
"This is an incredible victory and the right decision—access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional right. But let’s remember that we cannot let up in this fight: We need to take back the Senate and pass federal laws protecting reproductive rights."
"On today’s #PrideMonth anniversary, I’m asking you—if you’re able to donate—to support four terrific LGBTQ+ candidates who are fighting for an America that works for everyone:

Donald Trump can’t run from the facts: COVID-19 cases are still increasing and Americans are still dying. This is unacceptable—and Congress must act immediately to counter this reckless and inhumane measure.
"We need an Attorney General whose loyalty lies with our Constitution—not with the president. 

Congress must pass my bill to prevent William Barr from further interfering in matters that relate to Donald Trump and his campaign."

"Last year, I spoke with leaders who are still working to address the pain and suffering the Tulsa Race Massacre has inflicted on the Black community. We'll never be able to undo this act of hatred—but we must all do our part to fight for racial justice and defend Black lives."
"Black Wall Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma was one of the most prosperous Black communities in America. On May 31, 1921, white mobs attacked the community, murdering hundreds of Black Americans and ransacking Black businesses during 18 hours of racial terror."

Let's continue to defend the unshakeable truth that Black families matter and Black lives matter."
Emerald Garner and Angie Kearse are powerful women who are determined to turn their pain into meaningful police reform: The Eric Garner Act to outlaw chokeholds and the Andrew Kearse Act to hold officers criminally liable for denying medical care to those in custody.

"With lives and livelihoods at stake, the people deserve to know that their government’s only priority is their health and well-being—not personal profit. 

My colleagues and I are demanding answers."
".@Booker4KY is a lifelong Kentuckian who has seen how Mitch McConnell and Washington, D.C. have failed working families. I’m proud to endorse him and join his fight to root out corruption, dismantle systemic racism, and make big, structural change."
"It’s been a month since the House passed the #HEROESAct, and Mitch McConnell has yet to put it to a vote in the Senate. It’s long past time for McConnell to step up and make sure that struggling families in America can get the relief they desperately need."
The Supreme Court made the right choice to overturn Donald Trump’s cruel termination of DACA—but this fight is far from over. I’ll keep fighting to ensure Dreamers and their families have a path to citizenship in the country they call home. #HereToStay
"Giant companies scooping up relief meant for small businesses, inspectors general fired, promises to muzzle independent oversight.

Enough.

Taxpayers deserve to know where their money is going. We have to hold this administration accountable as it hands out trillions in relief."
"It shouldn’t take a book deal for members of this administration to come clean about impeachable offenses they witnessed from Trump.

There's a reason he thinks he’s above the law. Those around him—from his cabinet to Republicans in Congress—have failed to hold him accountable."
"The Trump administration repeatedly withheld COVID-19 emergency relief funds that Congress directed to Tribal Nations. Meanwhile, the pandemic ravaged Native communities. The administration’s actions to delay funding to Tribal Nations is disgraceful."
"Facebook isn’t taking any steps here to fix the fact that politicians can use Facebook ads to spread disinformation and lie without consequences.

Their inaction is threatening our democracy."

Let’s hold their loved ones close to our hearts and honor them with action by continuing the fight to dismantle white supremacy."

"Last year, I warned about the signs of another recession. Now, in the midst of a national pandemic, we're even more vulnerable to the devastating effects of an economic crisis. It’s long past time to build an economy that works for everyone."
".@AyannaPressley’s bold, principled leadership in Congress is more important than ever. I'm honored to fight alongside her and endorse her run for re-election."
Structural racism affects every part of our health care system—and this pandemic has only exacerbated the disparities that Black communities face.
"Across the country people are assembling to demand our government listen and address the systemic racism killing Black Americans. This is a powerful moment in our history, and we should all be inspired by their determination that change is possible."
"We’ve got 150 days until Election Day, and it's up to all of us to elect a leader who will fight for racial, social, and economic justice—and won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. Let’s get to work:"
"Eric Garner. Stephon Clark. Andrew Kearse. George Floyd.

Black lives matter. I’m proud to be @AyannaPressley’s partner in this fight."
"On a recent Women for Biden call, I spoke about Breonna Taylor. 

Breonna should be alive today. And her story happens every day across this country—Black women and girls are brutalized at alarming rates.

This is an epidemic and we must call it out."
There is no one-and-done solution to the systemic racism deeply embedded in our policing and our criminal justice system. But it’s clear that Donald Trump won’t hold police departments accountable—so Congress needs to step up now.
"I’m introducing legislation to reverse the Trump administration’s limits on the use of consent decrees, empower state AGs to pursue their own investigations into discriminatory policing, and triple funding for DOJ’s Civil Rights Division so they can pursue these cases."
We need systemic reform to address police brutality. But the federal government does have the power to investigate police departments with a history of discriminatory policing—a power that former AG Jeff Sessions severely constrained. Here's how we change that:
"White Americans need to be active, anti-racist allies—in this moment and beyond. I hope you’ll join us for this conversation."
"Breonna Taylor should still be alive and celebrating her 27th birthday today.

We must demand #JusticeForBre. Text ENOUGH to 55156."
"We honor their lives by continuing the fight for justice. For George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Eric Garner, Stephon Clark, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, and all the Black lives we've lost to racist violence."
"Today, George Floyd's family prepares for the painful task of laying to rest their loved one. As a country, we honor the life of George Floyd and mourn all the Black lives we've lost to police brutality and a broken criminal justice system."
"Police brutality threatens Black lives and our democracy. Every time activists and journalists are met with violence from the state, our fundamental rights are at stake. And any elected official who doesn’t take a stand is turning their back on our Constitution."
"Let's be clear about what happened this week at the White House. The photo-op Trump wanted was not just of himself holding a Bible—he wanted footage of Americans who disagree with him being scattered, of violence pushed upon them. That's the photo-op he wanted."
"This is just a start—and I’m in this for the long haul. Congress is responsible for holding this administration accountable—and anyone refusing to condemn their reckless, racist, and authoritarian actions shares responsibility for the consequences."
"I’m also introducing an NDAA amendment to create an Office for Civil Rights at the Pentagon to hold the Department of Defense accountable when it violates Americans’ civil rights or discriminates against them based on race, ethnicity, or religion."
I'm supporting Tim Kaine’s NDAA amendment to ban the use of military force against civilians. We've seen too many weapons of war used against peaceful protestors and military forces patrolling our streets. It's morally reprehensible—and should be illegal.

Breonna should be alive today. And her story happens every day across this country—Black women and girls are brutalized at alarming rates.

This is an epidemic and we must call it out."
There is no one-and-done solution to the systemic racism deeply embedded in our policing and our criminal justice system. But it’s clear that Donald Trump won’t hold police departments accountable—so Congress needs to step up now.
"I’m introducing legislation to reverse the Trump administration’s limits on the use of consent decrees, empower state AGs to pursue their own investigations into discriminatory policing, and triple funding for DOJ’s Civil Rights Division so they can pursue these cases."
We need systemic reform to address police brutality. But the federal government does have the power to investigate police departments with a history of discriminatory policing—a power that former AG Jeff Sessions severely constrained. Here's how we change that:
"White Americans need to be active, anti-racist allies—in this moment and beyond. I hope you’ll join us for this conversation."
"Breonna Taylor should still be alive and celebrating her 27th birthday today.

We must demand #JusticeForBre. Text ENOUGH to 55156."
"We honor their lives by continuing the fight for justice. For George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Eric Garner, Stephon Clark, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, and all the Black lives we've lost to racist violence."
"Today, George Floyd's family prepares for the painful task of laying to rest their loved one. As a country, we honor the life of George Floyd and mourn all the Black lives we've lost to police brutality and a broken criminal justice system."
"Police brutality threatens Black lives and our democracy. Every time activists and journalists are met with violence from the state, our fundamental rights are at stake. And any elected official who doesn’t take a stand is turning their back on our Constitution."
"Let's be clear about what happened this week at the White House. The photo-op Trump wanted was not just of himself holding a Bible—he wanted footage of Americans who disagree with him being scattered, of violence pushed upon them. That's the photo-op he wanted."
"This is just a start—and I’m in this for the long haul. Congress is responsible for holding this administration accountable—and anyone refusing to condemn their reckless, racist, and authoritarian actions shares responsibility for the consequences."
"I’m also introducing an NDAA amendment to create an Office for Civil Rights at the Pentagon to hold the Department of Defense accountable when it violates Americans’ civil rights or discriminates against them based on race, ethnicity, or religion."
I'm supporting Tim Kaine’s NDAA amendment to ban the use of military force against civilians. We've seen too many weapons of war used against peaceful protestors and military forces patrolling our streets. It's morally reprehensible—and should be illegal.
I’ve also demanded an investigation into the role Department of Defense officials may have played in the attacks on protesters in Lafayette Square—as well as in protests across the country.
I’m calling for Barr’s resignation—and for an investigation into any Justice Department officials involved in this gross display of propaganda and the violence that preceded it.
"Holding this morally bankrupt and relentlessly corrupt administration accountable is a critical job, and Congress needs to step up to the plate now more than ever.

Here’s how I’m working to demand answers and accountability this week:"
Eric Garner and George Floyd should be alive today. It’s appalling that chokeholds are still classified as an acceptable use of force. I support @Hakeem_Jeffries's bill to outlaw them and @SenGillibrand’s Senate introduction of it—this is just a start.
Barr should be impeached and removed immediately—this recklessness is going to get more people killed.
We must keep fighting structural racism and we must be relentless in supporting organizations promoting racial justice and dismantling white supremacy. Here are few of those organizations—please donate if you’re able to.
"Now more than ever, we need leaders who understand the root causes of the crises we face, and who are ready to make bold, progressive change. We need leaders like @Deb4CongressNM. She’s ready to stay in this fight, but she can’t do it alone—she needs your vote. 

Let’s do this!"
"The President of the United States tear-gassed peaceful protestors in order to clear the way for a useless photo-op outside the White House—just after vowing to activate the military against our own people. 

Lives and our democracy are in danger."
"What this moment calls for is a president willing to lead—someone who will fight for justice and accountability with moral clarity when times get hard and people are in pain. Instead, we have a president who spreads lies, sows anger and division, and then runs and hides."
"During LGBTQ+ Pride Month and always, we need to remember the Black Americans and LGBTQ+ people of color who put their bodies on the line so that others might be free. That fight is far from over. Let’s continue to fight against bigotry, hate, homophobia, and white supremacy."
"If you’re able, donate to these organizations as they continue to fight for racial justice in America. This is a small first step, but every action we take adds up, and our response to this moment will shape our future."
"We must be intentionally and relentlessly supporting Black communities and communities of color on the ground doing the critical work, day in and day out, to dismantle white supremacy across our country."
"We need to ask ourselves what we are doing proactively to dismantle systemic racism in our communities, our workplaces, and our circles of influence. It’s not enough to stand as an ally. We must be anti-racist."
"The idea that Black communities and people of color alone are responsible for fighting against racism every single day is misguided and can have dangerous consequences. White Americans have a serious responsibility, in this moment and beyond."
"Congress must lead in this moment and demand accountability. I support Rep. @AyannaPressley’s resolution condemning police brutality, racial profiling, and use of excessive force."
"There is a crisis within the crisis:

If we’re going to tackle this pandemic head-on, we can’t ignore its disproportionate effect on Black communities and the deep disparities that Black people have always faced in our health care system."
"As a society we have some soul searching to do. But the deep injustices we face are not inevitable. They were created and facilitated through racist, hateful, bigoted public policies. That means they can be addressed by different policies—brave, inclusive, moral public policies."
This tragedy tears us apart. My prayer is that this atrocity can lead to greater understanding and ultimately the grace we all need to ensure justice for all.
The idea that communities of color alone are responsible for fighting racism is misguided and can have dangerous consequences. It’s not enough to stand as an ally. We must be anti-racist. White Americans must ask ourselves what we are doing every day to dismantle systemic racism.
We have to make real change in our country and fundamentally reform how the law is enforced in America. We need accountability for law enforcement and accountability at every stage of our criminal justice system.

"Donald Trump is calling for violence against Black Americans. His advocacy of illegal, state-sponsored killing is horrific. Politicians who refuse to condemn it share responsibility for the consequences."

"I’m proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with @CartwrightPA in his run for re-election to Congress. We need leaders who are not afraid to fight for working families. Northeastern Pennsylvania needs an experienced, forward-thinking leader like Matt as their representative."
"I proudly endorse Chairman @JerryNadler in his run for re-election to Congress. His record shows that he doesn’t just know how to fight, he knows how to win. I’m honored to call Jerry a friend and someone I continue to work with on important legislation."
".@Biaggi4NY’s leadership in 2018 helped usher a wave of significant progressive victories in New York including in reproductive health, tenants’ rights, climate action, and immigrant rights. I’m proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with her in this fight."
"At a time when working families are being squeezed to their breaking point, we need fighters in the Senate like @MJHegar who embody strength, courage, and an unwavering commitment to putting people first. I'm proud to endorse her in the fight to deliver real results for Texas."
"From her famous filibuster on the Texas Senate floor for women's reproductive freedoms to working on the expansion of funding for public education, @WendyDavis has been fighting for working families for years—and I know she'll do the same in Congress. I'm proud to endorse her."
.@VoteGloriaJ knows firsthand the challenges that working families in Tennessee face. She will make sure no family goes broke paying for medical bills and will stand up to corrupt special interests. I'm proud to support her bid for re-election.
"As we meet this moment of crisis, @SDGeorgette's proven track record of fighting climate change and expanding affordable housing will be indispensable in Congress. I’m proud to add my voice to the broad coalition supporting Georgette."
".@Michelle4Kansas is a fearless fighter who knows the value of standing up for working families. As mayor of Topeka, she has proven herself to be a public servant whose first priority is the people. I’m proud to endorse her to represent the people of KS-02 in Congress."
"As a young Dreamer, @CatalinaCruzNY envisioned a bigger and brighter future for herself and for others—and today she is a fierce warrior for the structural change she envisioned. It is an honor to stand with Catalina in her fight for justice and equality."

".@LucyMcBath fights from the heart for the people of Georgia. As a mother and advocate, she's fought to keep our communities safe from gun violence, protect our health care, and keep our promises to veterans. I’m proud to endorse her in her run for re-election to Congress."
"It’s more important than ever to help elect leaders up and down the ballot who will champion bold reforms and put people first. Today, I’m proud to endorse another slate of candidates across the country. Take a look:"
But I can’t do it alone. Sign on to keep up the fight to protect our Postal Service:
"Donald Trump has threatened to veto any stimulus package that includes aid to the Postal Service, the most popular government agency in our country. We can't let Trump use this crisis to privatize or cripple the Postal Service—and I won’t stop fighting to protect it."
"This virus doesn’t discriminate based on immigration status—and our response shouldn’t either. I look forward to joining @UnitedWeDream, @JulianCastro, and community leaders to discuss how COVID-19 has impacted undocumented and immigrant communities."
Coronavirus remains a threat but some big corporations are planning to end premium pay for essential workers on the front lines—all while increasing profits and boosting paychecks for their execs. It’s time to pass the Essential Workers Bill of Rights.
"I’m proud to endorse Theresa @GreenfieldIowa in her run to represent Iowa in the United States Senate. Her life has been defined by hard work, determination, and resolve—I know she’ll put the needs of Iowa’s working families first."
The public deserves to know that their government is working for them—not corporate execs and their wealthy friends. Treasury and the Fed need to answer the questions posed by the Congressional Oversight Committee.
"An Inspector General’s job is to serve as independent government oversight for the American people to ensure that hard-earned taxpayer money isn’t being misused. 

Anybody who fears this kind of oversight has something to hide."
"Once again: You can’t just “re-open” our economy with a tweet. You need to do the work, day in and day out, to make sure that our communities can stay safe. And that means—to start—implementing programs like widespread testing and national contact tracing."
Calling grassroots supporters is one of my favorite things to do. It’s even more fun with a surprise guest!
"Bailey and I are back to answer kids’ questions about coronavirus! We made this episode for kids who are at home right now, missing their friends and missing school."
"36 million people have filed for unemployment in the last two months.

But for too many, our economy wasn’t working long before COVID-19. As we recover, we must build an economy that works for everyone—not just those at the top."
"Dogs are family, and it’s so clear Rayne was an important part of yours. I’m so sorry for your loss, Nathaniel."
Just found this wonderful memory of baby Bailey on my phone. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
"There's still time to act. We can put in place programs like widespread testing and national contact tracing to protect our communities.

That’s how we’ll restart our economy: Make a plan and do the work, day after day, to ensure people are safe."
"I've said it before and I'll say it again: Trump doesn't like to be accountable to anyone⁠—that's why he fires IGs left and right.

Strong oversight is only a threat to those who have something to hide."
"Once again, Trump has disposed of an Inspector General whose role was to serve as independent government oversight on behalf of the American people—and once again, he’s appointed a close ally to the role instead. 

This is corruption—plain and simple."

"The solutions to halting the virus are at our fingertips. Widespread testing, nationwide contact tracing, and public manufacturing are some of the programs we need to execute now.

The Trump administration needs to step up before we lose even more lives."
"Racism has shaped too many aspects of our economic and health care systems for far too long—and COVID-19 isn’t just exposing those disparities, it’s making them worse.  

Any meaningful response to this crisis must address racial disparities head-on."
"I look forward to joining @LatinoVictoryUS, @RepAndyVargas, @JossieValentin, and @JayesGreenJ for the #LatinosConBiden virtual Unity Town Hall tomorrow!"

"Last month, @RoKhanna and I called for an Essential Workers Bill of Rights to guarantee basic protections for workers on the front lines.

Thanks to your grassroots support, we’ve secured many of these key measures in the HEROES Act—and we won’t stop fighting until it’s law."
Every eligible American should have the option to vote by mail or to safely vote in-person.
We can’t rebuild our economy without first stopping the spread of COVID-19. House Democrats have already included pieces of Rep. @Andy_Levin and my national contact tracing plan in their proposed relief package—and Congress should do more.
"As @JoeBiden and I have said, all members of Congress and government officials responsible for the recovery programs should be required to refuse to own or trade individual stocks while in office. We need strong protections from conflicts of interest."
"We can’t allow companies to use this crisis to boost their profits and consolidate their power while crushing workers who are already struggling to make ends meet. 

Rep. @AOC and I are calling for a moratorium on big mergers and Congress should pass it."
"While Jeff Bezos is on track to become the world’s first trillionaire in the middle of a pandemic, Amazon is ending overtime pay for warehouse and delivery workers on the front lines. This is immoral."

We can't erase decades of inequality overnight, but we can start by making sure essential workers have the rights and protections they need.

My piece with @RoKhanna:"

We need to fight for bold changes to help those who need it most—during this crisis and beyond."
"We’re running out of time to save lives—and the Trump administration has yet to come up with a plan. 

We need to ramp up testing, contact tracing, and other critical measures now in order to keep our communities safe and begin to restart our economy."
"Donald Trump and his cronies are trying to undermine the postal service. 

Congress must shore up USPS so everyone can continue to receive the essential supplies they need and as many Americans as possible have the option to safely vote from home."
"Sen. Patty Murray, Sen. Tina Smith, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, and I have partnered up to make sure that workers’ rights aren’t thrown off to the side because of a public health emergency."
"Dr. Fauci is right. 

If we don't ramp up testing, if we don't get a national contact tracing program in place, and if we don't follow the social distancing guidelines, then the next wave of COVID-19 is going to cause even more unnecessary deaths."

We are running out of time to save lives.

We need to act now."

"Trump thinks that if we just ignore the bad news about how this virus spreads and how dangerous it is, it'll go away.

But it won’t.

We need to ramp up testing, contact tracing, and other critical measures immediately if we're going to avoid more preventable illness and death."
"I’ll be joining @Maddow tonight to break down what I learned from Dr. Fauci today:

We do not have the coronavirus under control—and if we don’t respond adequately and immediately, we’re going to see a resurgence in the fall and winter."
The Trump administration’s inability to come up with a plan to get us out of this economic disaster isn’t just a policy failure—it’s a moral failure.
"This is the right way to conduct oversight. 

Thank you @JoeBiden for committing to appoint a truly independent Inspector General and for tackling corruption head-on."
"Trump has played politics and catered to his cronies at every step of his ""response"" to this crisis. My bill with Sen. Blumenthal, Rep. @PramilaJayapal and Rep. @JohnSarbanes will hold this administration accountable and ensure they can't use coronavirus as cover for corruption."
"Donald Trump’s view on oversight is ""I'll be the oversight.""

@JoeBiden, on the other hand, is committed to building a resilient system to tackle corruption.

I'll state the obvious: These are two very different views on government accountability—and only one of them is right."
"More than 80,000 people are dead, Senator. Is there a number that would make this more urgent for you?"

"Coronavirus poses a threat to free and fair elections. But we can fix that.

We need vote by mail. We need online and same-day registration. We need early voting and extended voting hours. We need real money for governments to administer elections safely."

This is a good step taken by Gov. @GavinNewsom. Voters shouldn’t have to choose between participating in our democracy and keeping themselves safe and healthy. It’s time to do the same nationwide and expand vote-by-mail and make in-person voting safer.
"We're seeing the worst economic period since the Great Depression—and families who were already struggling are bearing the brunt of it. 

They need meaningful help like student debt cancellation, increased Social Security benefits, and sustained unemployment benefits."
"Our response to this pandemic must recognize an unshakeable truth: Racism, discrimination, and biases have left the Black community in even greater danger during the coronavirus outbreak."
"The last time our country saw unemployment numbers like this, we had a president and a government with a plan.

That’s the leadership we need to elect in November. And that’s what I’ll keep fighting for."
"Hello, Daniel!"

"The U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April—the worst since the Great Depression. 

It's inexcusable that the Trump administration has no plan for widespread testing and contact tracing to keep people safe and help prevent economic devastation."
"We need an Attorney General whose loyalty is to the Constitution, not the president. William Barr must resign."
Donald Trump is once again putting another wealthy donor into a position that demands real experience and leadership—and at a time when survival of the USPS couldn’t be more critical. This is corruption at its worst.
Donald Trump will stop at nothing to take away people’s health care coverage—even as our country faces one of the worst health crises in our history.
This #NationalPrayerDay I ask for comfort for every family and community who has lost someone to this outbreak. Give us the grace to lean on your divine wisdom and the courage to stand in the gap for the most vulnerable among us.
"The Trump White House has ignored the advice of disease experts, medical professionals, and scientists—and now they’re rejecting CDC guidance for businesses and workers. They’ve botched the national response to this crisis and we’ll hold them accountable."
"Amazon has fired at least four workers who had publicly raised concerns about safety conditions in Amazon warehouses.

My colleagues and I are demanding answers."
"As I said, Jared Kushner shouldn’t be overseeing anything—especially our response to a national crisis."
Racism has shaped crucial aspects of our economic and political systems for generations—and this pandemic and unfolding recession are no exception. Our response to this crisis must address structural racism head-on.
"Now is not the time to let our guard down. 

We need widespread testing and a national contact tracing program to get ahead of this virus once and for all."

Donald Trump will stop at nothing to take away people’s health care coverage—even as our country faces one of the worst health crises in our history.
This #NationalPrayerDay I ask for comfort for every family and community who has lost someone to this outbreak. Give us the grace to lean on your divine wisdom and the courage to stand in the gap for the most vulnerable among us.
"The Trump White House has ignored the advice of disease experts, medical professionals, and scientists—and now they’re rejecting CDC guidance for businesses and workers. They’ve botched the national response to this crisis and we’ll hold them accountable."
"Amazon has fired at least four workers who had publicly raised concerns about safety conditions in Amazon warehouses.

My colleagues and I are demanding answers."
"As I said, Jared Kushner shouldn’t be overseeing anything—especially our response to a national crisis."
Racism has shaped crucial aspects of our economic and political systems for generations—and this pandemic and unfolding recession are no exception. Our response to this crisis must address structural racism head-on.
"Now is not the time to let our guard down. 

We need widespread testing and a national contact tracing program to get ahead of this virus once and for all."
"I called Andrew—an essential worker in construction—to thank him for everything he’s doing and for chipping in to support Democrats up and down the ballot. 

He answered the phone from the top of the Jefferson Memorial."
The Trump administration has botched the response to a national crisis. No amount of excuses can cover that up—and we will hold him accountable.
To our nurses: Your compassion and dedication to doing the necessary and dangerous work of saving lives is awe-inspiring. I promise to keep fighting my heart out to get you the PPE and essential protections you need. #NationalNursesDay
"We need to make voting by mail an option in every state—and ensure that in-person voting is safe, easy, and accessible.

I’ve got a plan for that, and Congress can take it up at any time. 

Call your representative and demand it: (202) 224-3121"
"Ahmaud Arbery was just out for a jog—and he was gunned down.

This video is deeply sickening, and the fact that no action has been taken after two months is unacceptable. Ahmaud’s friends and family deserve accountability and justice."
"Child care providers are part of the backbone of our economy—and protecting them must be part of any meaningful recovery. Period. 

I’m fighting alongside @TinaSmithMN to make sure they have the funds to stay afloat during this crisis."
"If we’re going to tackle this crisis head on, we can’t ignore its disproportionate effect on Black communities and the deep disparities in our health care system."
"We need strong oversight. We need to hold the Trump administration accountable. 

The public deserves to know that their government is working for them during this pandemic and beyond—not corporate execs and their wealthy friends."
Congratulations @Leahgreenb and @ezralevin! I have no doubt that you will be excellent parents and will teach your little one to fight righteous fights. Can’t wait to meet him.
I’m demanding answers from Brian Miller about his ability to serve independently from an administration that seems to dodge transparency and accountability at every turn. I hope he comes prepared to answer these questions during today’s hearings.
"In this role, Miller publicly brushed off requests from Congress for information during the impeachment proceedings and the White House Counsel’s office refused to cooperate with several other congressional requests."
"In 2018, Miller joined the White House legal team, counseling Donald Trump on several issues, including the impeachment proceedings."
"Let’s talk about Trump’s nominee for Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery. If confirmed, Brian Miller would be responsible for overseeing investigations into billions of dollars in loans from the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package."
"I’m glad to see cities taking up the fight to make sure essential workers are getting the rights, protections, and compensation they deserve.

The @NYCcouncil should pass an Essential Workers Bill of Rights—and Congress should follow suit."
"The Trump administration is privately projecting a steady rise in coronavirus deaths—while publicly encouraging states to open back up. 

This is shameful, even by their standards."
"This pandemic has exposed the disparities that rural communities—especially rural communities of color—have to deal with every single day. 

In the richest country in the world, everyone deserves high-quality health care—no matter where they live."
"Relief for student loan borrowers shouldn’t be left up to technicalities. 

We must cancel student loan debt—so people get the real relief they need during this crisis and beyond."
"Nonmedical hospital workers are putting their lives on the line, but often have access to less protective gear than their coworkers. It's not enough to thank them—all essential workers should have the PPE they need to stay safe. #StandWithEssentialWorkers"
"Leilani Jordan was an essential worker who went out of her way to help elderly shoppers with their grocery needs. She risked her life to help others—we must do our part to honor her.

It’s long past time for Congress to pass an Essential Workers Bill of Rights."
"The details of how this protective equipment is being distributed should not be kept secret. 

I'm demanding answers from the medical supply companies who are working with Jared Kushner on his secretive Project Airbridge."
"I called Andrew—an essential worker in construction—to thank him for everything he’s doing and for chipping in to support Democrats up and down the ballot.

"This #TeacherAppreciationWeek comes at a time when teachers have gone above and beyond to make our kids feel safe and cared for in the middle of a global pandemic. 

Today, and every day, we thank you for answering the call to shape the minds of our future leaders."
"Bailey and I are back to answer kids’ questions about the coronavirus!

Have a question for us from your little one? Send it here, and we’ll try to answer it next:"
"On today’s World Press Freedom Day, we’re reminded that freedom of the press is a foundational part of democracy—and one of the most important tools for holding our leaders to account. I will fight to protect the First Amendment."
"If we’re going to reshape our country and our economy, we need to be willing to fight for bold, structural solutions to the problems we face as a nation. I’m grateful for the AAPI leaders across the country who are driving these fights in their communities."
"Discrimination has consequences—but data erasure often serves to mask those consequences. In February, with input from AAPI community leaders and policy experts, I called for disaggregated data. Now, as we fight COVID-19, it’s more important than ever."
"The AAPI community includes nearly 50 diverse racial and ethnic groups, but the data we gather today doesn’t capture the richness of the communities—or significant differences on key economic and social outcomes."
"May is #AAPIHeritageMonth, an important time to celebrate and honor Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, leaders, and history. I’m grateful for the AAPI leaders across the country who are fighting for bold, progressive reforms in their communities and beyond."
"I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is our most corrupt president in modern history.

But he’s just the worst symptom of a corrupt system. It’s time to root out corruption at every level and make our government work for the people."
"Real unemployment is soaring. But for many, our economy wasn’t working even before COVID-19. As we recover, we have the opportunity to create an economy that works for everyone. That begins with a government that is accountable to the people—and that is what we will deliver."
"Every Trump administration official and business executive contemplating wasteful, corrupt deals and giveaways should hear us loud and clear: Donald Trump may wink and nod at this corruption, but we will not."
".@JoeBiden will appoint an Inspector General to review every CARES Act transaction currently evading serious scrutiny. Wasteful, corrupt deals will be rooted out and undone. Suspicious transactions will be referred to the Justice Department for investigation and prosecution."
"If Congress and the Trump administration are unwilling to act now, then we will ensure that these changes are made in January 2021—both through new legislation and immediate executive commitments made by the @JoeBiden administration."
"3️⃣ Oversight: Inspectors General should be shielded from removal except for “good cause” and whistleblowers must be protected. The Congressional Oversight Commission needs subpoena power and authority to oversee all aspects of recovery, including the Paycheck Protection Program."
2️⃣ Lobbying: It's time to close loopholes and require more extensive reporting. Big corporations that apply for or accept bailout funds should not be able to engage in political spending or use their resources and political clout to lobby for bailout legislation that helps them.
"1️⃣ Conflicts of Interest: We need strong, vigorously enforced protections. For example, both of us have long refused to own or trade individual stocks while in office. That should be required of members of Congress and government officials responsible for the recovery programs."
"As senators overseeing the executive branch and as executive officials answering to independent oversight, @JoeBiden and I know oversight is vital. As we both argued in the primary, we must end corruption and guarantee a government that works for the people."
"The CARES Act imposed some oversight, but when he signed it, Trump said he’d ignore the law and prevent a new Inspector General from communicating with Congress. He then appointed a loyalist to that role and fired another IG independently designated to oversee the bailout."
"Trump seems to think he can direct funding for the response to this crisis based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he's trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich—all without any accountability."
"Government delivers best when its actions are fair, transparent, and accountable. Donald Trump’s approach to COVID-19 has been anything but—and we must take broad, urgent action to stop his administration’s corruption. Read my new op-ed with @JoeBiden:"
"When it comes to his handling of this pandemic, Donald Trump has a view on oversight: He doesn't want any.

Make no mistake: We will keep doing our jobs and holding him accountable for his botched response to a national crisis."

We need a bold, actionable plan that prepares us for a post-coronavirus economy that keeps our communities safe—not a vision board from these two."
"Happy birthday to my favorite actor @TheRock! 

Sending you and your beautiful family lots of love (and keep singing to Tia while she washes her hands)."
Brief update from our birthday boy!
"On this #MayDay, I’m proud to stand in solidarity with essential workers who are exercising their right to strike to demand fair wages and basic protections—especially when we're leaning on them most."
"Millions of Americans were already spending more than 30% of their income on rent—and with more than 30 million now out of work, @JulianCastro is exactly right: We need #RentReliefNow."
"This year, we learned Bailey really likes burritos. For his birthday today, we treated him to one with his name on it. Happy birthday, Bailey!"
Thank your mom for me for putting people first. Sending her all my love during these uncertain times.
"I stand in solidarity with all workers on strike this #MayDay. And you can #StandWithEssentialWorkers, too. 

Call your representative to demand they pass the Essential Workers Bill of Rights and step up to protect essential workers:"
"The halt on citizenship interviews and oath ceremonies may be preventing over 100,000 people from completing the naturalization process.

I’m joining @AmyKlobuchar and my colleagues to urge @USCIS to adopt tech solutions to keep this process going."
"Hospitals are already facing shortages of critical supplies like masks, ventilators, and prescription drugs to fight COVID-19. Our federal government can help—and voters agree that it must."
"Kevin is a respiratory therapist and a disabled veteran. He understands crisis, and he understands that our leadership’s response has been horrendous. I gave him a call to say thanks—and to share how we’re fighting to keep workers like him safe. #StandWithEssentialWorkers"
"Our country’s leadership is in crisis, and the need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot has never been more clear. If you’re able, please consider chipping in a few bucks before midnight to help—we can only do this together."
"Donald Trump and his incompetent administration have botched a national response to this pandemic, and have yet to come up with a concrete plan for our economy. 

Congress must step up and provide the real solutions Americans desperately need."
"These candidates are fighting their hearts out to win—and we’re doing everything we can to support them. 

If you’re able, pitch in whatever you can before tonight’s deadline and join the fight to help Democrats win everywhere:"
"I’m joining @BernieSanders, @PramilaJayapal, and @MarkPocan tonight at 7pm ET to talk about the priorities we’ll be fighting for in the next coronavirus relief package. I hope you’ll tune in!"
Donald Trump still isn’t using the Defense Production Act to get our frontline workers the equipment they need. That’s why I’m partnering with @RepSchakowsky to propose a bill that would rapidly produce the equipment and supplies Americans are counting on.
"This administration has endangered countless lives by spreading medical misinformation, denying supplies where they're needed most, and putting politics over public health every step of the way. 

This isn’t a great success story, Jared—it’s a historic failure."
All six of these women need our support to win Republican-held seats and help make sure we protect—and expand—our majority. We’re not just playing defense—we’re going on offense. Join the fight and split a donation today:
"Christy Smith will fight for her constituents in CA-25 to lower the cost of prescription drugs, make health care more affordable, provide American workers access to paid sick leave, and ensure the needs of families come first."
"We need Kara Eastman representing NE-2. She'll join the fights on protecting health care, tackling student debt, and taking on corporate power—with the passion and effectiveness that she's already shown as a social worker, a nonprofit leader, and a champion for change."
"Jared Kushner shouldn’t be overseeing anything—much less part of a national response to this crisis.

"Celeste Williams is running to represent AR-3 because she believes no one should go broke because they get sick, that all people deserve access to a world class education, and that workers in America should be treated with dignity."
"As an educator and former school board leader, Candace Valenzuela knows first-hand the struggles that working families face—especially in TX-24. I know she’ll be an unwavering force in Congress who will fight tirelessly for them both at home and in Washington."
"Gina Ortiz-Jones will be a tireless champion for working families in Congress. She’ll stand up to corporate special interests and fight for quality, affordable health care, a fair and compassionate immigration system, and an economy that works for everyone. Let's do this, TX-23!"
"Protecting our House majority is critical. But if we're going to get this government working for the people, we have to expand that majority—not just maintain it.

Tune in to join the conversation—and to join the fight for an Essential Workers Bill of Rights."
"If we don’t step up and protect the mom-and-pop shops during this pandemic, companies and investors flush with cash will take this chance to gobble them up at a time when they’re most vulnerable.

@AOC and I are fighting to put a moratorium on big mergers."
The only way we ensure that these loans are going to the people who need them is by making sure there are real strings attached to protect our workers—because you better believe the Trump administration will do whatever it can to help its wealthy friends.
"This virus doesn’t discriminate based on immigration status—and our response shouldn’t either. 

We need to make sure everyone gets the coronavirus aid and economic relief they deserve."
"I got a note yesterday from Sarah, a nurse in Utah. She and her husband are health care workers who can't afford time off to care for their girls because of student loan debt. We need to cancel student debt—during this crisis and beyond."
The Trump administration’s process for distributing medical supplies appears to be driven by politics instead of public health—and we need answers.
"Once again: If we’re only testing people with symptoms who make it to the hospital, then we are far from understanding this crisis.

We need to drastically ramp up testing—and we need to do it now."
Donald Trump has had an arsenal of tools at his disposal to prevent medical workers from having to make these gut-wrenching decisions—and he’s decided to not use them. This is appalling.
"I’m fighting for essential workers like Christina—a critical care nurse for over 30 years who’s been using the same mask to care for infected patients for four nights in a row, because her hospital doesn’t have enough PPE. #StandWithEssentialWorkers"
"There is something fundamentally wrong when billionaires are getting richer in the middle of a pandemic while hospitals are struggling to find PPE, essential workers are left without protections, and millions of families are scrambling to make ends meet."
Economic inequity has given the big Wall Street investors and private equity firms an opportunity to gobble up small businesses at a time when they’re most vulnerable. We can’t let that happen—and @AOC and I are fighting to put a moratorium on these practices.
"During this crisis, the last thing we need is large companies and predatory private equity firms buying out struggling small business owners. And as @AOC says, these practices would have decades-long consequences. I’m proud to be her partner in this fight."
"Last year, we got to celebrate Bruce’s birthday at the same spot where I took him to lunch the first time he came to Houston to meet my family. This year, the celebration might have looked a little different—but it was still filled with love.

Happy birthday, sweetie!"
"I was glad to talk with @AOC today about the Essential Workers Bill of Rights.

We called it a Bill of Rights for a reason. This is the minimum. The basics. The people keeping this country going deserve dignity and respect.

Join our fight:"
"This pandemic isn’t just exposing the disparities that exist for communities of color—it’s making them worse.  

@CoryBooker, @AndrewYang, and my colleagues in Congress are right: standing together in this fight means we need to address these systemic problems head on."
"As an Associate Justice of the Ho-Chunk Supreme Court, President of the Wausau School Board, a professor, and a lawyer, Tricia Zunker has the vision and courage Wisconsinites need during this crisis—and I'm proud to have her back in the special election in WI-7."

"I’m fighting for essential workers like Christina—a critical care nurse for over 30 years who’s been using the same mask to care for infected patients for four nights in a row, because her hospital doesn’t have enough PPE. #StandWithEssentialWorkers"
"There is something fundamentally wrong when billionaires are getting richer in the middle of a pandemic while hospitals are struggling to find PPE, essential workers are left without protections, and millions of families are scrambling to make ends meet."
Economic inequity has given the big Wall Street investors and private equity firms an opportunity to gobble up small businesses at a time when they’re most vulnerable. We can’t let that happen—and @AOC and I are fighting to put a moratorium on these practices.
"During this crisis, the last thing we need is large companies and predatory private equity firms buying out struggling small business owners. And as @AOC says, these practices would have decades-long consequences. I’m proud to be her partner in this fight."
"Last year, we got to celebrate Bruce’s birthday at the same spot where I took him to lunch the first time he came to Houston to meet my family. This year, the celebration might have looked a little different—but it was still filled with love.

Happy birthday, sweetie!"
"I was glad to talk with @AOC today about the Essential Workers Bill of Rights.

We called it a Bill of Rights for a reason. This is the minimum. The basics. The people keeping this country going deserve dignity and respect.

Join our fight:"
"This pandemic isn’t just exposing the disparities that exist for communities of color—it’s making them worse.  

@CoryBooker, @AndrewYang, and my colleagues in Congress are right: standing together in this fight means we need to address these systemic problems head on."
It’s time to demand an Essential Workers Bill of Rights. Take a few minutes to call your representative and stand with our frontline workers.
"If you’re an essential worker, Congress needs to hear from you. Tell us what you’re seeing on the front lines—post about your story or share your story through the link below. 

And if you know someone who is an essential worker, share this post with them."
We are all depending on the sacrifices essential workers are making every day to keep our country safe and healthy. It’s time to #StandWithEssentialWorkers and demand an Essential Workers Bill of Rights:
"This morning, @AyannaPressley, @Deb4CongressNM, @RoKhanna, and I got together to launch the #StandWithEssentialWorkers Day of Action—and we’re asking you to join us in the fight to protect our essential workers. 

Here’s our conversation if you missed it."
".@AyannaPressley, @Deb4CongressNM, @RoKhanna, and I are kicking off the #StandWithEssentialWorkers Day of Action. Tune in and find out how you can be a part of the movement to protect essential workers."
I’ll be joining @AOC live on Instagram at 2:30pm ET to talk more about how Congress needs to pass an Essential Workers Bill of Rights and how we must all #StandWithEssentialWorkers—today and every day.
I’ve been getting a lot of questions from kids about what’s going on with the coronavirus. Bailey and I thought we’d answer them together!
Donald Trump’s words matter because he is the president of the United States—and his words have consequences.
Thank you @TriciaForWI for calling this out: No one should have to choose between their health and their vote.
"I look forward to joining @Deb4CongressNM, @AyannaPressley, and @RoKhanna for our #StandWithEssentialWorkers Day of Action kickoff on Monday at 10 AM ET—join us!"
"Reopening states too soon will come at the risk of losing progress we’ve made in slowing down the spread of coronavirus. 

Here’s a better option: A proactive plan to stop this virus in its tracks—and that includes establishing a nationwide contact tracing program."
"It's vital that Congress hears from workers themselves about their experiences on the front lines leading our pandemic response. 

Share your story below and know that I will keep fighting for you as hard as I fight for my own family. #StandWithEssentialWorkers"
"Thank you, today and every day, for all you do, essential workers. You're keeping an uncertain nation afloat, and you deserve better. That’s exactly what we’re going to keep fighting for. 

Join us on Monday and #StandWithEssentialWorkers."
"I am so sorry for your loss, Nelini. I’m in this fight with you and I promise you that I will keep fighting so that Congress will #PutPeopleFirst."
"If you’re looking for ways to support our frontline workers and are able to do so, please consider donating to coronavirus relief funds like the ones set up by @DomesticWorkers, @FeedingAmerica, and @CDCFound. The only way we’ll get through this is if we do it together."
"On #SOULSaturday, I’m joining @JoeBiden and thanking our essential workers who have always been the backbone of our nation’s response in times of crisis—and that’s even more true during the coronavirus pandemic."
"The U.S. has used contact tracing to stop the spread of STDs and tuberculosis, and other countries have begun to use this tool to stop the spread of COVID-19. Congress must step up so we can stop chasing after this virus and start fighting it head-on."
"Working with state, local, and tribal governments, the @CDCgov will coordinate a strategy to hire, train, and deploy contact tracers who explain to people that have been in close contact with infected patients what they need to do to stay safe while protecting their privacy."
"To confront a national crisis, we need a proactive nationwide strategy—and the Trump administration is failing to come up with one. Rep. @Andy_Levin and I have laid out a plan for a national contact tracing program that will stop the virus in its tracks."
We need to #BreakUpBigTech. Pass it on.

"This email from Courtney in Brooklyn stuck with me: “We’re waiting for our leadership to catch up to our values.”

We can’t rely on local heroes using their own means to make masks and supplies. We need the government to stand up a national manufacturing infrastructure."
"There is a crisis within this crisis. 

Our response to this pandemic must center the unshakeable truth that racism, discrimination, and biases across our basic systems have left the Black community in greater danger during the coronavirus outbreak."
We shouldn’t be drinking or injecting disinfectants. Let's not further overwhelm our medical professionals—and let’s not take medical advice from someone who tried to convince America that the coronavirus was a hoax.
"I’m grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care of him, but it’s hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say “I love you” one more time—and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close. I'll miss you dearly my brother."
"What made him extra special was his smile—quick and crooked, it always seemed to generate its own light, one that lit up everyone around him."
"My oldest brother, Don Reed, died from coronavirus on Tuesday evening. He joined the Air Force at 19 and spent his career in the military, including five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam. He was charming and funny, a natural leader."
He's misled the public from the start. He's allocating resources based on which governors he likes best. His family and their cronies are making policy decisions in backroom deals. Enough is enough. We need an investigation into Trump's pandemic response.
"There’s a critical special election coming up in California’s 25th district in just a few weeks. Please consider chipping in to support Christy Smith’s campaign, if you’re able. I trust her to put people first during this public health and economic crisis."
Go Sydney and Gina! This is how we’re going to win—together.
"Real change takes a grassroots movement fighting from the outside—and bold leaders fighting from the inside.

Today I endorsed a group of those leaders who are running up and down the ballot and all across the country in 2020.

Join the fight with us:"
".@RevDrBarber is right: Wherever it goes, this pandemic will highlight how poverty—and our willingness to let people remain in it—presents a clear and present danger for all of us."
"This #EarthDay, let’s hold the Trump administration accountable for putting our planet at risk—and for using this pandemic as a cover to roll back the rules that keep our air and water clean."
"Our righteous fights continue—and that means doing everything we can to help elect leaders who will put power in the hands of the people.

I’m proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with these women. Join us at   and let’s make sure Democrats win everywhere."
"We can’t let predatory companies try to make an extra buck by squeezing people already struggling to make ends meet.

We need tougher rules against price gouging and stricter enforcement. I’m glad to partner with @KamalaHarris on this important work."
"There are many policies (including several I’ve proposed just today!) that will support families and help keep our economy afloat—and don’t involve putting even more lives at risk. 

I strongly recommend Dan Patrick read up:"
"I’ll say this for as long as the Trump administration needs to hear it: We need to ramp up testing—and we need to do it now. 

If we’re only testing people with symptoms who make it to the hospital, then we are far from understanding this crisis."
"We need to provide immediate and comprehensive relief to consumers in the next coronavirus relief package. @SherrodBrown and I have a plan to stop banks from snatching stimulus checks, pause payments, prevent credit damage, cancel student debt, and more."
"Immigrants are on the front lines of the coronavirus response, putting their lives at risk to make sure our communities are fed, healthy, and safe. The Trump administration needs to stop using this pandemic as cover to implement their xenophobic agenda."
"When it comes to his handling of this pandemic, Donald Trump has a view on oversight: He doesn't want any.

But Donald Trump can't fire a free press, he can't fire Congress—and he sure can't fire me.

We’ll be watching his every move and holding him accountable."

I stand with the governors across the country who are doing everything they can to keep their states and their communities healthy and safe.
I’ll be joining @AlmaForCongress soon to talk about how we must address the Black maternal mortality crisis in our country. I hope you’ll tune in!
It’s long past time to legalize marijuana and create a cannabis industry that’s open to all—and begin to repair the damage caused by our current criminal justice system.
"Americans around the country agree that we need government action to help rebuild our economy—and strong guardrails to ensure taxpayer dollars aren’t just going to the wealthy and well-connected.

That’s what I’ll be pushing for in the next stimulus."
I’ve said this again and again: This administration must act immediately to dramatically expand our coronavirus testing capacity.

We will keep doing our jobs and holding him accountable over his failed management of this pandemic."
"Donald Trump doesn't like checks on his power. That's why Congress needs to step up.

In the next stimulus, any taxpayer bailout to giant corporations must come with real strings attached—and I've got a plan for that."
"The CDC is releasing some of the COVID-19 race and ethnicity data that my colleagues and I called for in our bill. It’s a good first step, but there are still gaps in the data—we must expand COVID-19 data collection to address disparities and save lives."
"There’s one easy thing we can do for our democracy as we stay at home: Make sure we’re counted. Filling out the Census ensures that communities can get the resources and funding they need—and it only takes a few minutes!  

Don’t wait—get counted today."
Bruce and I are thinking of you and sending you our best wishes for a full and speedy recovery.
"Jared Kushner and his private sector buddies shouldn't be making policy decisions in secret to further line their pockets and leave millions of families behind. 

The White House must comply with ethics and conflict of interest laws—even in a pandemic."
Stimulus checks should be going straight to families’ pockets to cushion the financial blow from the pandemic—they shouldn’t be seized by greedy banks and debt collectors. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin must step up and protect our families.
"Yet again, the Trump administration is using the coronavirus crisis to weaken regulations on industry emissions—despite emerging scientific links between air pollution and COVID-19 death rates. This needs to stop now."
"We need the Oversight Commission to make sure relief funds are directly supporting workers⁠—not wealthy CEOs and investors.

My friend @BharatRamamurti is right: Congress needs to fill the commission now so it can get to work."
"Nobody should have to choose between protecting their health and exercising their right to vote—and all of us should get involved to make sure we win in November to keep future elections free and fair. Thanks for having me on #BrightMinded, @MileyCyrus!"
Essential workers are the backbone of our nation's response to coronavirus. They put their lives on the line every day. Our next coronavirus relief package must close these loopholes to protect their health and financial security.

"We’ve seen the importance of having a leader that people can count on in the middle of a crisis. And that’s not Donald Trump. It’s @JoeBiden.

So go to   and pitch in if you’re able or send some texts—because we truly are in this together now."
"What I hear most often in the notes people send me is simply “please help” and “don’t stop the fight.”

Congress must get back to work and pass the bold reforms we need to help families through this crisis and save our economy—and I’ve got a plan for that."
I loved my video call with @FullFrontalSamB! We talked about what’s gone wrong with this administration’s coronavirus response (pretty much all of it) and what we can do to make it better (keep voters safe—to start).
"I’ll be on @Maddow tonight to talk about my endorsement of @JoeBiden and how we can all get in the fight to win in November. 

Tune in!"
"Delaying much-needed stimulus checks to help families survive a crisis he exacerbated in order to stroke his own ego is as reckless as it is ridiculous.

The fact that we’ve come to expect this kind of behavior doesn’t make it acceptable."
"Our child care system is on the verge of collapsing beneath the economic burden of this pandemic. If we don't act, millions of parents will be unable to return to work and our economic recovery will suffer. @TinaSmithMN and I have a plan to fix it—before it's too late."
"Families across the country need help—and they need it now. 

Mitch McConnell should do his job and let us continue to work on the relief package needed to save lives and our economy."
Trump’s decision to cut funds from the World Health Organization—which is on the front lines of researching and delivering treatments for coronavirus—is deeply reckless and does nothing to distract from his mismanagement of this crisis from the beginning.
"Now it’s up to all of us to help make @JoeBiden the next president. Let’s get to work. Go to   right now, and chip in your $5, make some calls, send some texts—because we are all in this together."
"In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government—and I’ve seen Joe Biden help our nation rebuild. Today, I’m proud to endorse @JoeBiden as President of the United States."
"Stay home! 

But when you can’t stay home—stay safe. 

Sending strength from my family to yours."
"If we say “we’re all in this together” we have to mean it. 

I stand with essential workers—and Congress must do the same. 

Demand an Essential Workers Bill of Rights:"
"Early data on coronavirus is alarming: It appears to be infecting and killing people of color at higher rates.

I just introduced legislation with my friends in the House to mandate the collection of racial data on coronavirus.

We need this data to save lives."
The next coronavirus relief package must put all workers front and center—and it must include the policies @RoKhanna and I outlined in our Essential Workers Bill of Rights. Join us as we fight to ensure frontline workers are protected during this pandemic.
Yes we do.
The Treasury Department is allowing banks to seize stimulus checks from the people who need them most. This is fundamentally wrong. People—not banks—need relief now.
"Elections are the beating heart of our democracy. 

If we force Americans to choose between voting this November or staying safe from the virus—then democracy as we know it will be lost."
"Nurses. Domestic workers. Delivery drivers. Janitorial staff. 

Essential workers are the backbone of our nation’s response to coronavirus—and we owe them the protections they need, the rights they are entitled to, and the compensation they deserve."

"In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government—and I’ve seen Joe Biden help our nation rebuild. Today, I’m proud to endorse @JoeBiden as President of the United States."
"Stay home! 

But when you can’t stay home—stay safe. 

Sending strength from my family to yours."
"If we say “we’re all in this together” we have to mean it. 

I stand with essential workers—and Congress must do the same. 

Demand an Essential Workers Bill of Rights:"
"Early data on coronavirus is alarming: It appears to be infecting and killing people of color at higher rates.

I just introduced legislation with my friends in the House to mandate the collection of racial data on coronavirus.

We need this data to save lives."
The next coronavirus relief package must put all workers front and center—and it must include the policies @RoKhanna and I outlined in our Essential Workers Bill of Rights. Join us as we fight to ensure frontline workers are protected during this pandemic.
Yes we do.
The Treasury Department is allowing banks to seize stimulus checks from the people who need them most. This is fundamentally wrong. People—not banks—need relief now.
"Elections are the beating heart of our democracy. 

If we force Americans to choose between voting this November or staying safe from the virus—then democracy as we know it will be lost."
"Nurses. Domestic workers. Delivery drivers. Janitorial staff. 

Essential workers are the backbone of our nation’s response to coronavirus—and we owe them the protections they need, the rights they are entitled to, and the compensation they deserve."
"It's like @RoKhanna said when I called him: There are 60 million Americans still going to work—and most aren’t getting the compensation or protection they deserve.

We’ve got a plan to fix it: The Essential Workers Bill of Rights. Learn more and sign on:"
"I sure do—and I’m ready to fight for it. 

Join me:"
"Congratulations, @JudgeKarofsky! I look forward to your leadership as a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice.

You said it best: Although you were successful, the way this election was conducted was unacceptable.

I promise to fight alongside you to ensure that never happens again."
"USPS workers have risked their own health to ensure America keeps running. That’s why I’m pushing for Congress to shore up USPS—so that everyone can continue to receive essential medicines and supplies, and citizens can vote from home. #SaveThePostOffice"
We must give essential workers the pay and benefits they deserve. Join us to call on Congress to ensure our country’s frontline workers are protected during this public health emergency.
The next relief package must put all workers front and center—but it must also specifically include the policies in our Essential Workers Bill of Rights.
"Essential workers are the backbone of our nation’s response to coronavirus. We have a responsibility to make sure they have the protections they need, the rights they are entitled to, and the compensation they deserve. #ProtectEssentialWorkers"
".@RoKhanna and I are proposing an Essential Workers Bill of Rights, focusing on ten key areas affecting frontline workers—including additional health and safety protections, robust premium pay, truly universal paid sick leave and family and medical leave, and more."
"Essential workers are working in high-risk conditions without appropriate equipment, safety standards, or job protections. Some reports indicate that they may be contracting COVID-19 at a higher rate than the general public."
"Our health care, janitorial, delivery, mail, transportation, farm, grocery, and domestic workers are on the front lines of this pandemic. @RoKhanna and I are urging Congress to enact needed protections for them in the next coronavirus relief package."
"Happy Easter Sunday!

Today, I’m remembering some of the lessons I learned in Sunday school at McFarlin Methodist Church in Oklahoma: By doing good and acting in service to one another, we can live a righteous life."
"Thank you Principal Williams for making sure not only that our kids are fed, but also that they know they are loved and cared for. 

People like Principal Williams give me hope. This is how we’ll get through this—together."
"Voters shouldn’t have to choose between participating in our democracy and keeping themselves safe. 

We need to ensure everyone can vote safely—and we can do so by expanding vote by mail, early voting, online registration, and more."
"Farmworkers are on the front lines of this pandemic, ensuring our communities are fed—and the Trump administration wants to reward them by cutting their pay. This is shameful. 

Make no mistake: We will fight for farmworkers with everything we’ve got."
"There have been too many reports of growing xenophobia against Asian Americans during this crisis. @MazieForHawaii, @TammyForIL, and I are asking the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights for help to stop these hateful attacks."
The Trump administration is failing health care workers and first responders. Our federal government must make sure that our medical professionals get the protective equipment they need.
"Our postal service is on the verge of collapse. I’m calling on Congress to act swiftly to shore up USPS so that everyone can continue to receive essential medicines and supplies, and as many Americans as possible can vote from home. #SaveThePostOffice"
"This is exactly why we need to collect racial data nationwide. If we don't assess the racial disparities on testing and treatment, we won't be able to allocate resources to the communities who need it most and save lives."
"Our country is in the middle of a public health crisis and an impending economic recession. 

Congress must end its recess and get back to work on the next coronavirus relief package—now. People’s lives and our democracy depend on it."
".@AyannaPressley, @EdMarkey, and I are demanding that @CMSgov release comprehensive data on COVID-19 testing, treatment, and fatalities by race and ethnicity. It’s essential to uncover disparities and ensure equal access to free testing and treatment."

In this crisis, we’ve seen that the most terrifying words are actually “We’re in a crisis and the government doesn’t have a plan to get us out.”"
We need a surge in testing capacity—not an end to it. This decision is absolutely irresponsible and potentially deadly.
This is a good step. Other states should follow—and I’m calling on Congress to include vote by mail and other steps in the next coronavirus relief package to keep voters across the country safe and strengthen our democracy.
17 million people have filed for unemployment in the last three weeks. And that doesn’t take into account the people who have been unable to file. It’s time for Congress to get back to work on the government actions we need now to save lives and our economy.
"Millions of people have lost their jobs—but business is booming for the lobbying industry. 

I will fight to break the grip that lobbyists have on Washington, and ensure the voices of people hurt by this crisis aren't drowned out by corporate interests."
"The chaos and the attempt to suppress the vote in Wisconsin should be a wake-up call for everyone. Congress needs to act immediately—and I’ll fight to ensure that, in the next coronavirus relief package, we include steps to keep voters safe and strengthen our democracy."
"Our health system is stretched to the brink. People of color are affected at disproportionate rates. Unemployment is approaching Depression-era levels. The scale of this crisis demands we do much more, much faster. The next round of policymaking must address these hard realities."
"Coronavirus poses a threat to free and fair elections. 

We need vote by mail. We need online and same-day registration. We need extended early voting and hours. We need real money for governments to administer elections safely."
"Taxpayer dollars must go to workers and state, local, and tribal governments first—not corporations. 

We need strong conflict-of-interest protections. We need a ban on political spending and lobbying by companies who get emergency assistance. We need better oversight."
"People and small businesses must come first during our economic recovery. 

We need to keep workers employed. We need new price gouging laws and enforcement. We need to protect small businesses from predatory takeovers."
"Frontline workers are putting their lives on the line. 

We need an Essential Workers Bill of Rights that includes paid leave, protective equipment, emergency safety standards, hazard pay, and collective bargaining."
"Families need economic relief beyond cash payments.

We need to suspend consumer debt collection. We need a true moratorium on evictions and foreclosures. We need to cancel student loan debt. We need to keep child care providers afloat and increase Social Security benefits."
"To contain this crisis, we need a surge in testing capacity. 

We need the government to be producing tests, PPE, drugs in shortage, and any future treatments that scientists develop—not in the thousands, but in the tens of millions."
"We’ve debated the role of government since our founding—but the time for cheap political shots at government is over. 

Congress must end recess to get back to work on the direct government actions we need to save lives and our economy. Here are my ideas:"
One of the many messages of Passover is hope over hardship. May Jewish communities around the country and around the world find joy this Passover—even though this year’s celebrations may look and feel very different. Chag Sameach.
Congress needs to act swiftly to fix the problems with this program and eliminate the cap on the total amount of money to keep workers employed. The government should guarantee that every small business that qualifies will get the help they desperately need—full stop.
"The confusing process of applying for PPP puts an extra, unnecessary burden on small business owners. Even if they’re able to apply, some big banks have shut out small businesses from being able to receive these loans altogether."
Small business owners are pleading for help—but the Payment Protection Program created to help America’s small businesses stay afloat and keep their workers on payroll has been nothing but a fiasco since its launch.
That fight does not end today. We’ll continue it together in the Senate and keep working to hold the wealthy and well-connected accountable to the people.

We need health care for all.
We need paid leave.

"What’s happening in Wisconsin is a disgrace.

During a pandemic we need voters to stay safe, not be silenced—and one simple way to do that is to allow all Americans to vote by mail, while also enhancing the safety of in-person voting.

Join the fight:"
This pandemic isn’t just exposing the disparities that exist for communities of color—it’s making them worse. We need comprehensive racial data on the people who are being affected by COVID-19 so we can address these systemic problems head on.
"This is outrageous. Americans are being asked to choose between participating in our democracy and keeping themselves safe. In the next coronavirus relief package, I’ll fight for a plan that ensures the health and safety of voters and protects our elections."
The task of protecting our democracy has never been more vital. Congress must do its part—and governors and state officials must also step up to protect our elections. Join our fight to make sure every American can vote safely in November:
"Our government needs to act immediately to ensure elections can proceed safely, securely, and on-time. But Donald Trump and right-wing Republicans are already using the crisis to disenfranchise millions."
"Finally, we must provide states with the resources they need to administer the vote and to keep poll workers safe. That means at least $4 billion for election administration, conditioned on states adopting specific measures that will protect voters and reduce barriers to voting."
"We must also protect the integrity of our elections during this time of crisis by countering disinformation and bolstering election security. Congress must provide states with funding to guard against foreign threats, and voters should be able to track their ballot at every step."
"States must also enhance the safety of in-person voting, as many voters may face greater obstacles to voting from home. All states should provide at least 30 days of early voting and extend voting hours to help prevent overcrowding and promote social distancing."
"While badly needed, these reforms will put additional stress on the already teetering United States Postal Service. Congress needs to act swiftly to shore up USPS so that as many Americans as possible can vote from home."
"Next, we need to make the process of casting a ballot easier and more accessible. States should mail every registered voter a ballot with pre-paid postage and waive requirements that undermine social distancing guidelines."
We must ensure that Americans can register to vote safely and easily. States must prevent voter purges and restore any voter whose name has been removed from the rolls since the pandemic began. Online and same-day registration should also be made available for everyone.
"As federal, state, and local governments rightfully issue stay-at-home orders and encourage residents to practice social distancing to combat the virus, large-scale, in-person voting on election day could present serious risks to public health."
"No American should have to choose between participating in our democracy and keeping themselves safe. In the next coronavirus relief package, I’m fighting for a plan to protect the health and safety of voters and strengthen our democracy for the long haul."

"52 years ago, the course of American history changed when we lost a great leader—but his dream lives on. Today and every day, we are the heirs of Dr. King’s dream and we are called to continue fighting for social, racial, and economic justice."

We’ll get through this together."
"Our jails and prisons are overcrowded and lack basic hygiene options and health care.

It’s not only inhumane—it makes coronavirus outbreaks inevitable. And as staff cycle through, it will spread.

States must act to reduce jail and prison populations."

I talked to @SignalBoostShow about the warning signs we saw back in January, and how my plans to respond were ignored.

But each day there’s more we can do—and I’ll keep fighting for solutions to this crisis."
"Donald Trump made a show of sending off the USNS Comfort. But because of a tangle of bureaucracy, it's sitting mostly idle. States need real resources to fight this pandemic, not elaborate displays that feed Trump's ego."
This is ridiculous. States shouldn’t have to be bidding against each other with private companies to get the resources they desperately need. The federal government needs to send supplies directly to the states—now.
Mike Pence and Donald Trump have made it clear—Americans without health insurance are on their own. It’s disgraceful. The federal government must step up and ensure everyone is covered.
"That is, in fact, exactly what it’s there for. Get states the resources they need, or get out of the way."
"This administration has consistently failed Puerto Rico. Facing yet another crisis, Puerto Rico must get every resource it needs to fight coronavirus. And Mike Pence needs to do his job."
"Wisconsin, the deadline to request an absentee ballot has been extended to today at 5pm!"
"That’s why last week @AyannaPressley and I sent a letter to HHS urging them to collect and release racial data on coronavirus. I’m grateful that our colleagues @CoryBooker, @KamalaHarris and @RobinLynneKelly have signed on—and I urge others to do the same."
"Our health care system is rife with racial disparities. Racial data on coronavirus will be critical to ensuring an equitable and just response to this crisis across the board.

But we don’t have that data—yet."
People experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable during this crisis. I've introduced a bill with @AyannaPressley and @RashidaTlaib to provide critical support now to keep everyone safe.
Google shouldn't be deciding which side of any issue the public gets to hear about. No tech company should have that kind of power to control the flow of information or put their thumb on the scale. We need to #BreakUpBigTech.
"And months before Democrats could select their nominee, they sold their most prominent YouTube ad on Election Day to the Trump campaign."
"Unfortunately, this is part of a larger pattern. Google refused to prohibit false ads on their platforms. They imposed drastic restrictions on targeting for political ads that make it difficult and more costly for Democrats to communicate."
"Trump's response to this crisis has been slow, insufficient, and driven by his ego instead of the advice of medical experts. But Google refused to allow anyone to use their platforms to call him out for it and only changed their stance after public outcry."

"That’s why last week @AyannaPressley and I sent a letter to HHS urging them to collect and release racial data on coronavirus. I’m grateful that our colleagues @CoryBooker, @KamalaHarris and @RobinLynneKelly have signed on—and I urge others to do the same."
"Our health care system is rife with racial disparities. Racial data on coronavirus will be critical to ensuring an equitable and just response to this crisis across the board.

But we don’t have that data—yet."
People experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable during this crisis. I've introduced a bill with @AyannaPressley and @RashidaTlaib to provide critical support now to keep everyone safe.
Google shouldn't be deciding which side of any issue the public gets to hear about. No tech company should have that kind of power to control the flow of information or put their thumb on the scale. We need to #BreakUpBigTech.
"And months before Democrats could select their nominee, they sold their most prominent YouTube ad on Election Day to the Trump campaign."
"Unfortunately, this is part of a larger pattern. Google refused to prohibit false ads on their platforms. They imposed drastic restrictions on targeting for political ads that make it difficult and more costly for Democrats to communicate."
"Trump's response to this crisis has been slow, insufficient, and driven by his ego instead of the advice of medical experts. But Google refused to allow anyone to use their platforms to call him out for it and only changed their stance after public outcry."
Donald Trump must re-open the federal Obamacare exchanges now to help Americans get the coverage they need.
"Make your voice heard, and keep yourself safe. Request an absentee ballot before today’s deadline, and vote for Jill Karofsky for the Wisconsin Supreme Court."
Families are in a crisis. They need help—and they need it now. The Senate doesn’t have time to waste on recess. Mitch McConnell needs to get back to work now.
"This is why my anti-corruption plan would ban the practice of government officials trading individual stocks while in office—and I’m encouraged to see friends like @AOC taking up this fight in the House. 

Let’s shut this down once and for all."
"Insider trading to profit off a pandemic isn’t just morally reprehensible—it’s illegal. 

We need a serious investigation into these allegations and immediate accountability."
"The 2020 census will determine your community's resources and representation for the next decade. It’s critically important that you and your family are counted. 

But don’t take it from me—take it from @StaceyAbrams! 

#CensusDay"
"Good. 

Corporations have a responsibility to protect their employees during this crisis. If they’re failing, employees must be able to raise concerns without fear of retribution."
"It's important to have plans to get in front of a crisis rather than chasing it from behind. If we had put in place a plan to deal with the coronavirus in January we would've saved lives, and we would be better prepared for the public health and economic crisis that we’re in now."
"I hope you're all keeping healthy and safe. Bruce, Bailey, and I are staying home. We will get through social distancing together—because it’s one of the best things we can do to help."
"Governors have made it clear: They need support from the federal government. Before we spend a single penny to bail out giant corporations, we need to make sure that cities and states have all the resources they need to fight this pandemic."
"I'm proud to support @VoteYesForMPS, because every child deserves a quality, equitable education, no matter where they live."
".@Uber, @Instacart, @DoorDash, and @Grubhub have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and the public. They must reclassify their workers as employees, not independent contractors, to ensure they get essential protections and benefits."
Looking forward to chatting with @SethMeyers on @LateNightSeth tonight at 12:35 ET!
This crisis is disproportionately impacting the low-paid women who are working on the front lines. That's why it's not enough to just help them survive this crisis—we need to rebuild our economy so that it works for women and their families. #EqualPayDay
"Bailout funds should be used to keep workers on payroll, not to enrich executives. I'll be watching the Trump administration—closely."
"This agreement between @CWAUnion and @ATT to cancel stock buybacks and support workers shows how we can not only support our families during this crisis—but how we can rebuild a stronger, more resilient economy for the future."
The Trump administration has failed to provide states with the necessary resources and medical supplies to fight this pandemic. Now they're outbidding the states and seizing our orders. I'm demanding answers.
"This #TransDayOfVisibility, I want all trans and non-binary people to know you are valued, you are loved, and that we will keep fighting to make sure you can live freely, safely, and openly exactly as you are."
"I’m sending you and your mother all my love, David. I’m so grateful for all she does to keep us healthy, and wish both of you a speedy and safe recovery."
Racial disparities in our health care system may mean that Black and Brown communities don't receive equal testing and treatment for coronavirus. @AyannaPressley and I want to make sure this data is collected—and addressed.

"We need to be doing everything we can to avoid a housing crisis, and @JulianCastro has a plan."
I stand with every worker providing essential services during this crisis. Add your name if you're joining the #InstacartStrike today.
"I'm supporting Instacart workers on strike today. They are providing an essential service to those who cannot leave their homes now. They deserve better pay, benefits, and protections. #InstacartStrike"
"Racist, bigoted language about the coronavirus is driving a surge of violence and hate crimes. It must stop—now."
"In 2008, the financial crisis drove our economy to the brink of collapse. As we face another economic recession, @RichCordray reminds us in his new book that the fight to build the CFPB left us a roadmap to make government a force for good even in challenging times."
We need to go further to ensure health care providers have the resources they need to expand testing across the country. Here's how we should do it.
"In the midst of a pandemic and an economic crisis, the Trump administration just made it easier for predatory payday lenders to exploit struggling families. This is an appalling, dangerous move that will trap more families in a punishing cycle of debt."
"DACA recipients are working hard to support their families and communities, and to ensure they and their loved ones are safe and healthy. Thousands of them are health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic. I stand with them in this fight. #HomeIsHere"
We're still fighting righteous fights. Join our movement to put people first in fighting for the relief measures we desperately need today—and rally around candidates who support bold solutions to rebuild our economy in the long term:
Profit margins don't come before people’s lives.
This is not the time for Congress to go on recess. Our work isn't done. We need to force Trump to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up the development of tests and necessary equipment for health care professionals. And we need to do more to help struggling families.
"We're so grateful for the doctors, nurses, and health care professionals who are doing the dangerous, necessary work of caring for people with coronavirus. I'll keep fighting to make sure they have the equipment and resources they need."
We have more work to do here to fight this pandemic and help workers and families weather this crisis. This isn't the time to take a recess.
"This bill provides immediate, necessary aid⁠—but it's insufficient. Tomorrow, we keep fighting for more aid for families, hospitals, and small businesses. And I'll do everything I can to hold the Trump administration accountable for how it spends this $450 billion taxpayer fund."
"Staying at home helps slow the spread of coronavirus and protects medically vulnerable people like Xiomara. If we reopen too early, we are all at risk. We can support our economy and help people stay at home to protect everyone from coronavirus."
"Our obligation, our moral imperative, is to save lives. If people are forced out of their homes too early and thousands or millions more people die because hospitals and health care providers are overwhelmed, there won't be an economy left to save."
"We shouldn't be choosing giant corporations over those who need resources the most. I'm fighting for a stimulus package that supports workers, small businesses, and gets direct, immediate relief to hospitals, community health centers, and health care workers."
"Any stimulus must support workers’ payroll and benefits—not enrich wealthy executives of giant corporations. If we want to weather this crisis, we need to build the economy from the grassroots up."

Gig workers are doing essential work during this crisis. They need and deserve essential benefits like paid sick leave. Good on New York City for considering legislation to mandate paid sick leave for gig workers.
"Gaping holes in @Amazon, @Walmart, and @McDonalds's paid sick leave policies will put workers, their colleagues, and their communities at greater risk. I urge them to provide all of their workers with adequate paid sick leave to help protect lives."
".@PineStreetInn is helping ensure vulnerable individuals have the necessities they need, helping move homeless individuals into homes, and assisting formerly homeless individuals in retaining housing."
".@Gr8BosFoodBank is working with food pantries, community meal programs, and other food assistance providers throughout Eastern Massachusetts to support families, seniors, and individuals."
The Boston Resiliency Fund is supporting Boston residents most affected by this crisis.
".@GlobalGiving is helping send doctors, nurses, and other frontline responders to communities in need, and delivering essential items to hospitals, clinics, and to struggling families and older individuals."
".@CDCFound's Coronavirus Defense Fund is helping communities prevent and detect coronavirus, helping deploy emergency staff, and helping deliver food and medical supplies to those in need who are isolated."
.@AmeriCares is training health workers on the frontlines of this crisis and providing personal protective equipment to health care professionals.
.@NoKidHungry is helping feed kids who aren't getting healthy meals due to school closures.

".@OneFairWage is providing cash assistance to restaurant workers, car service drivers, delivery workers, personal service workers, and more who are impacted."
".@DomesticWorkers's Coronavirus Care Fund is helping support in-home care workers, nannies, and house cleaners during this crisis."
We need all hands on deck to support our neighbors and communities through this crisis. Here are just a few charities and organizations whose work you can support right now if you're able:
"To every nurse, doctor, and health care professional, to every grocery worker keeping the shelves stocked, to every first responder, every domestic worker, and everyone who is on the front lines of this crisis, we are so grateful for everything you're doing."
There is something fundamentally wrong when a Wall Street CEO can get a 19% raise while millions of Americans are struggling to figure out their next paycheck.
"We need to rapidly ramp up our ability to test for coronavirus. That means we need to keep up the pressure to ensure we have enough testing kits, testing locations, and resources in our communities. Keep calling your representatives. Keep the pressure up."
Any taxpayer assistance that goes to giant corporations must come with real strings attached to ensure the money is truly going to support the workforce through this crisis.
"It's not enough to just waive student loan debt payments during this crisis. If we want to stimulate the economy and minimize the burden of a financial crisis, canceling student loan debt must be part of the next coronavirus stimulus package."
Health care providers are on the front lines of this crisis and we’re so grateful for their selfless work. I’m working to get federal resources toward making sure they get the protective gear and supplies they need.

"The number of coronavirus cases is growing, and we need more resources to care for new patients. Today I'm requesting that Donald Trump deploy the Army Corps of Engineers to retrofit existing facilities to care for patients with coronavirus."
Congrats to @Marie4Congress on winning her primary election in #IL03! This isn’t a moment to back down—it’s the time to fight back. And Illinois families are getting the unwavering champion they deserve.
"Airline executives spent billions on stock buybacks and are now asking taxpayers for billions. We need to help airline workers, but that money should come with serious long-term change to the companies—no more buybacks, a $15 minimum wage, and more."
We need a stimulus package that supports our economy from the grassroots up and permanently improves the lives of families. We can put money directly in their hands by increasing Social Security payments and by canceling student loan debt.
The most pressing issue is ensuring that everyone who needs a test for coronavirus can get one—for free. But just a half step behind the health crisis is the financial crisis. We need a stimulus package big enough to meet the moment.
"I'll be on @AllInWithChris soon to talk about why we need a stimulus package that directly helps working families. If we want to weather this crisis, we need to support our economy from the grassroots up."
"The coronavirus outbreak has been declared a national emergency and we all need to do our part to stop its spread. Follow the guidance from your state, local, and federal officials, and stay up-to-date with the latest information from @CDCgov here."
"We can help people stay home if they're sick and support our economy by:
-Creating an emergency paid leave program
-Increasing Social Security checks by $200 per month
-Expanding unemployment benefits
-Canceling student loan debt"
"We need to show that we have a government that understands the scale of coronavirus’s threat to the economy and public health. The way to tackle both is to get money into the hands of the people so they can stay home if sick, but still support this economy from the ground up."
We can all help slow the spread of coronavirus by taking simple steps. It is important to listen to the public health experts. Follow @CDCgov for updates on how to protect yourself and others.
"The lack of widespread coronavirus testing in the United States is a disgrace. If we hope to control this outbreak, the administration must immediately allocate funds to state and local health systems and rapidly stand up testing capacity nationwide."
"This crisis also reminds us we need public officials who will serve the public interest. We need a clear-eyed, data-driven assessment of the problems we face, and a comprehensive plan that matches the scale of those problems."
This administration cut funding for public health agencies and put politics and spin ahead of good science. They've put former finance executives in charge of his economic policy to push policies that’ve been great for banks but have made our economy less resilient.
"Trump's proposed economic response is inadequate. I'm proposing a $750 billion stimulus package, including:
-Fully paid leave
-Unemployment insurance boosts
-Aid to state governments
-Funding for vaccine development
-Social Security benefit increases
-Student debt cancellation"
"I’m calling on the administration to issue a Stafford Act declaration that will open key funding and regulatory flexibility to help our health system. We need to rapidly expand diagnostic testing, help prepare our hospitals and local leaders, and fund care for the uninsured."
"I am deeply concerned about the threat that coronavirus poses. Trump’s stumbling response is putting American lives and the economy at greater risk. I offered a plan ten days ago, and today I updated it based on the latest data and expert recommendations."
"Back in July, I warned an economic crash could be coming. One serious shock would be enough—and the Trump administration's incompetent response to the coronavirus is already weakening our economy."
"Our economy was already showing cracks before the coronavirus. But an incompetent administration leading the response, engaged in magical thinking, is only making this crisis worse."

"I believe in the America that we can build together. Thank you, Detroit!"
Trickle down economics has been a failure. We need to build an economy from the grassroots up.
"Polls are still open in some #SuperTuesday states! If you haven’t voted yet, find your polling location now and get out and vote!"
"Polls are still open. If you’re still in line when polls close, stay in line! Find your polling location here:"
I believe in the America that we can build together.
"Every day in the selfie lines, I hear the stories from people who are struggling, who need a government that's on their side, not the side of the billionaires and giant corporations. They're why I'm in this fight."
"Yes, these are hard times. Yes, people are afraid. And the danger is real. Our very democracy hangs in the balance. But Latinx and Chicano history teaches us the power of fighting back."
"I’m so happy to be in Michigan, tonight! Tune in as we go live from Detroit, a city full of fighters, dreamers, and persisters."
"There are only a few more hours before polls begin to close in #SuperTuesday states across the country.

If you’ve been on the sidelines, now’s the time to get in this fight and chip in a few bucks."
"Hope over fear.
Courage over cynicism.

Let’s do this together. Vote:"
"Thank you @NWPCNational, I’m grateful for your endorsement!"
"We are facing a homelessness crisis—but it is not inevitable. That's why I've got a plan that will lower rents and invest real federal resources to help build or rehab more than 3 million homes across the country. Everyone deserves a safe, decent, affordable place to live."
"Thank you, @sandylocks. Your pioneering of the intersectional framework and your powerful voice have driven groundbreaking work. I'm deeply humbled by your vote today, and I will proudly fight with you for racial, gender, and economic justice."
"I voted today with hope in my heart. 

I believe in this grassroots movement. I believe in the America we can build together. 

Let's dream big, fight hard, and get out to vote!"
"I’m so grateful to have Congressman Mike Honda’s endorsement. Together, we’ll build a country and an economy that works for everyone."
"Thank you, @RWPUSA. Together, we can root out the corruption in Washington—and I’ve got the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate to get it done."
I'm fighting to build an America where Cynthia and her neighbors all have the opportunity to thrive. I'm grateful for her support—and I'm grateful for everyone knocking doors and making phone calls today.
"The Federal Reserve alone can't solve the economic and public health problems that coronavirus poses. I'm calling on Congress to act now to ensure everyone gets care for free, pass an emergency paid leave program, and enact at least a $400 billion fiscal stimulus package."
I know that we will one day elect a woman to the White House.
"Our work continues, the fight goes on, and big dreams never die. From the bottom of my heart, thank you."
"I believe in the America that we can build together. Thank you, Detroit!"
Trickle down economics has been a failure. We need to build an economy from the grassroots up.

"Polls are still open. If you’re still in line when polls close, stay in line! Find your polling location here:"
I believe in the America that we can build together.
"Every day in the selfie lines, I hear the stories from people who are struggling, who need a government that's on their side, not the side of the billionaires and giant corporations. They're why I'm in this fight."
"Yes, these are hard times. Yes, people are afraid. And the danger is real. Our very democracy hangs in the balance. But Latinx and Chicano history teaches us the power of fighting back."
"I’m so happy to be in Michigan, tonight! Tune in as we go live from Detroit, a city full of fighters, dreamers, and persisters."
"There are only a few more hours before polls begin to close in #SuperTuesday states across the country.

If you’ve been on the sidelines, now’s the time to get in this fight and chip in a few bucks."
"Hope over fear.
Courage over cynicism.

Let’s do this together. Vote:"
"Thank you @NWPCNational, I’m grateful for your endorsement!"
"We are facing a homelessness crisis—but it is not inevitable. That's why I've got a plan that will lower rents and invest real federal resources to help build or rehab more than 3 million homes across the country. Everyone deserves a safe, decent, affordable place to live."
"Thank you, @sandylocks. Your pioneering of the intersectional framework and your powerful voice have driven groundbreaking work. I'm deeply humbled by your vote today, and I will proudly fight with you for racial, gender, and economic justice."

I’m grateful for every person who gets in this fight. Will you donate $2 to our campaign before noon? This is our moment in history."

"My new plan for coronavirus response:
1. Ensure every American can get all recommended care for coronavirus for free.

"Thank you for voting for me in Texas, @LizzyBeezKneez. You really did your homework!"

I've got a real plan to deal with the coronavirus."
"I don't have just one plan for the climate crisis—I've got plans for the #GreenNewDeal, a #BlueNewDeal, a clean energy economy, environmental justice, creating 10 million good jobs, and rooting out corruption in our government.

Progressive ideas are popular ideas. @JulianCastro and I aren't afraid to fight for them.
Donald Trump's border wall is a monument to hate—and his  latest attempt to treat the southern border as a war zone rather than as a vibrant community. It's time to stop Donald Trump's militarization of the border.
Wow—that’s pretty impressive!
Mike Pence paid more attention to politics than science and gravely worsened a health crisis in Indiana. I can't think of a worse person to put in charge of dealing with coronavirus.
"Today is Nuclear Victims Remembrance Day in the Marshall Islands, honoring the victims of U.S. nuclear testing there. The U.S. must continue to ensure survivors receive the support and health care they need. We must also work to end nuclear testing once and for all."

"I've persisted against the odds my entire life. We face big challenges in 2020, but I'm not afraid to fight."
Proud to be fighting alongside you for South Carolina's schools!
"Our February fundraising numbers could be the last thing voters see before they head to the polls on #SuperTuesday.

Will you chip in $2 right now to help reach our new goal of $29 million before the FEC deadline tonight at midnight?"
"After Faith pitched in a few bucks to our campaign, I gave her a call to say thanks. She told me that her daughter just won a debate in her class! Winning debates and running for president—that’s what girls do. Donate too, and I could call you next:"
"Get out and vote, South Carolina!"
The future of our democracy is at stake. @JohnLegend and I are ready to fight—join us.
"Billionaires don’t have to worry about FEC fundraising goals.

But we do.

Will you chip in $2 right now to help reach our goal before the FEC deadline at midnight tonight?"
"I know how to get government working for people again because I've done it before, when I launched the CFPB.

If you want a president who knows how to respond to a crisis—whether it's a financial crash or the coronavirus—I've got the experience and the drive to do the job."
"The most important FEC deadline of our campaign is tomorrow at midnight.

We need our fundraising numbers to be as strong as possible. But right now, we’re behind where we want to be to hit our goal.

Will you chip in $2 to help power our campaign?"
We spend billions on an immigration system that breaks up families and keeps thousands locked up—with little evidence that it makes us any safer. We need to live our values. I am committed to a fair and welcoming immigration system that reduces immigration detention by 75%.
"My #WealthTax would pay for Universal Child Care, high-quality public education, student loan debt cancellation, universal free public college, and help fully finance #MedicareForAll.

"Thank you, @JenSiebelNewsom! You've broken the mold and reshaped the First Partner’s office to advocate for equal pay and women's representation. Your work empowers women and girls in California and across the country. Proud to be in this fight by your side!"
"As a former teacher, I know how important well-maintained classrooms are for our children. That’s why I support the Proposition 13 School Safety Bond, which will invest directly into California classrooms to ensure students are learning in safe, healthy, and secure facilities."
"Stripping citizens of their citizenship sets a dangerous precedent and opens the door to abuse. As president, I will stand up for all Americans, regardless of where they were born, and I will fight to protect our immigrant communities."
"I'm proud to partner with @MsPeoples and @BlackWomxnFor in this fight for big, structural change, and I know they will continue to hold me accountable."
"The next president will need to rebuild our government. I've got plans to invest in our federal workforce, root out the corruption of the Trump administration, and ensure key positions are filled. And I'll fight to ensure our federal workforce looks like the rest of America."
"Join us in East Los Angeles on Monday, March 2 at 5:30 PM PT, as we talk about the power and values of Latinas and Chicanas in American history and how we can learn from them as we continue fighting for big, structural change."
"I've been raising the alarm for years. Our economy is working better and better for a thinner slice at the top, while working families are being squeezed to the breaking point. We need big, structural change to build an economy that works for everyone."
"Our FEC deadline is tomorrow, so tonight I’m making some calls to grassroots donors to say thank you!

Chip in $2 or whatever you can now, and I could call you to say thanks. I believe in the power of our grassroots movement. We can only do this together."
"This is excellent news. Donald Trump's cruel ""Remain in Mexico"" policy put asylum seekers in danger. As president, I will reverse the Trump administration's cruel immigration policies and ensure that asylum seekers are welcomed at our borders."

"We're looking at a serious economic downturn because of coronavirus—and the Trump administration is bungling every aspect of this crisis.

The Trump administration's careless incompetence has put lives at risk. Punishing whistleblowers shows how unwilling they are to take responsibility. It's time for a competent leader in the White House to manage this crisis.

Read my full plan to ensure our federal government is accountable to border communities:
"A few steps to one side of the border shouldn't mean you forfeit basic rights. As president, I’ll work to reverse this decision legislatively to ensure accountability for victims of border patrol violence—regardless of what side of the border you’re on."
We need to get our priorities straight and focus on keeping the American people safe—not funding a monument to hate. I've introduced a bill to divert every dime Donald Trump is spending on his racist wall to fighting the coronavirus.
"Border communities reflect the best of America, but too often politicians in Washington degrade and divide them for political gain. I've got a plan to stop Donald Trump's militarization of the border and fight for safe, prosperous border communities."
Farmers like Germaine Jenkins are supporting their communities—and we need to ensure that they have the opportunity to succeed. I'm fighting for a new farm economy that meaningfully includes farmers of color and environmental justice so that small farmers like her can thrive.
How do we get more women into presidential politics? Elect one for president. I'm ready. #CNNTownHall

"At the same time, overcrowded prisons too often fail to meet basic human rights standards. Under existing conditions, these sentences are inhumane. A president can use her clemency powers to right systemic injustice—and I plan to do just that."
"Data show that people tend to age out of crime and are less likely to recidivate, but thousands of elderly people remain behind bars. Those serving sentences equivalent to life are disproportionately Black and Brown, many for nonviolent crimes or crimes committed as juveniles."
"Today I'm announcing that, in a Warren administration, we will create a clemency board that will prioritize cases of older Americans incarcerated for unduly long sentences and establish a presumption of release, unless the board finds a danger to public safety."
"The president has significant powers to grant clemency and pardons, and historically presidents have used that power broadly. But today’s hierarchical process at DOJ results in relatively few and conservative clemency recommendations."
My heart aches for Kaia. This is absolutely unacceptable. No student should have to learn in an environment where there is a threat of incarceration. We need to reduce police presence in schools and invest in the resources and support our students need.
"The Trump administration is bungling the response to coronavirus, putting our public health and our economy at risk. We need a real plan to respond to outbreaks—and an adult in charge."
We need a Justice Department and a president that treats white supremacy as the domestic terrorism threat it is. And we need a president who will fight to end the gun violence epidemic. #CNNTownHall

The gun industry and the NRA are calling the shots in Washington instead of the American people. It’s corruption plain and simple—and that’s why fighting corruption is at the top of my agenda. #CNNTownHall

"Bridgette’s experience highlights many of the problems of our criminal justice system—from how it fails to protect survivors of domestic violence, to the injustice of mandatory minimums, to the lack of rehabilitative services. That's why I've got a comprehensive plan for reform."
"Tommy Young died in a county jail, where he was being held because he couldn't afford to pay the $100 bond. 

It's long past time to end the punitive financial burden that is cash bail."
We can't allow affluent and mostly white hedge-funders and capital investors to hoard the profits from the same behavior that led to the incarceration of generations Black and Latino youth. We must ensure equity in accessing the cannabis industry.
"LGBTQ+ South Carolinians face significant disparities in both their health and their health care. This is why we need #MedicareForAll—and to ensure LGBTQ+ people get the equitable, gender-affirming, and culturally-competent health care they need."
"Thank you, @JackBlack! I’m grateful to have you on #TeamWarren."
"I am deeply grateful for @AngelicaCHIRLA's endorsement. I will proudly fight beside her to protect the rights of immigrants and refugees, and to build a country of our best values."
"I will carry Rachel and Ramona's story with me to the White House. And I'll fight for #MedicareForAll for their family, and every family in our country."
I'm so grateful and humbled that Usree is putting her trust in me with her first vote as a U.S. citizen. My promise to Usree’s family and to every family in America is this: I will keep fighting so your kids get the health care and education they need and deserve.
"Will we let the fear hold us back, or are we going to fight back? Me, I'm fighting back. Thank you, Denver!"
.@TIDEVINE's experience trying to get necessary medication for her daughter has become a sad reality of the American health care system. No one should be able to make a profit off denying people the care and medication they need. This is why I’m fighting for #MedicareForAll.
"Katherine Johnson was a trailblazer whose work sent Americans to the moon, and is still being used to send us into space today. Her incredible legacy will continue to inspire generations of girls everywhere."
We’re less than a week away from the South Carolina primary—and it’s all hands on deck. Will you chip in $2 or whatever you can right now? These are crucial moments that will make all the difference.
"I wasn’t born a politician. But I was born a fighter. And I’m not afraid to fight for big, structural change. Thank you, Seattle!"
"We can't afford to nickel and dime essential health and aid programs. We need to act—now. Read my full plan to prevent, contain, and treat infectious disease outbreaks like coronavirus."
"We need all hands on deck now to fight the spread of coronavirus. While Donald Trump has no plan and proposes dramatic cuts to the CDC, the World Health Organization, and other global health programs, I proposed a plan nearly a month ago to fight global pandemics."
"Selfies, pinkie promises, hugs and games are the best ways to kick off an event!"
I'm proud to partner with @KerryDonovanSD5 and @SenadoraJulie in this fight for families in Colorado and across the country.

"Denver is ready to dream big and fight hard! Tune in for our live town hall, happening now."
I’m so grateful to have @CMichaelHuntley on my team!
Legalizing marijuana is about more than just allowing its use. It’s about undoing a century of racist policy that disproportionately targeted Black and Latino communities and rebuilding the communities that have suffered the most harm.
"My friends and colleagues @KamalaHarris and @CoryBooker have led the fight to repair the damage done by failed anti-marijuana policies. I am proud to support the MORE Act and the Marijuana Justice Act, and will continue to fight for those reforms as president."
"I've got a plan to legalize marijuana, rebuild communities devastated by failed anti-marijuana policies, and ensure that those communities are equally able to participate in the budding cannabis industry. Here’s how we’ll do it."
"Since Wednesday night, our movement has been growing everywhere. This fight is our fight—join us."
We need to address the stigma around mental health and make sure that everyone has the full health care coverage they need—including mental health care. #MedicareForAll ensures that everyone has the health care they need.
"Starting your own business is hard—and it's especially hard for women and people of color. I've got a plan to help entrepreneurs start small businesses, and give them the opportunity to thrive."
We're about to go live from our town hall in Seattle—join us!
"Teachers deserve fair pay, and students need more mental health resources. And as a former special ed teacher, I know those educators need manageable workloads to best support their students. I stand with the teachers of @SPFE28."
"Thank you, @IndivisTampaBay, I'm so grateful for your endorsement!"
"I stopped by a caucus in Henderson, Nevada, to say hello to volunteers and caucusgoers. Thank you to everyone who participated in democracy today!"
This is excellent news—and it should be the standard everywhere. My administration will fight for climate justice and make sure frontline communities who have suffered the effects of industrial pollution—overwhelmingly Black and Brown communities—lead the conversation.
"I'm so grateful that @JohnLegend will be joining @SCforWarren and me next week to help us get out the vote—join us!

Orangeburg:   
Charleston:"
"Who will we meet, @JohnLegend?"
I've had it with billionaires who think the rules don't apply to them.
"This moment demands urgency. I will partner with Latina activists and organizers—and together, we will fight for the big, structural change we need."
"I proudly fought beside @SenatorReid and @BarackObama to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crash. As president, I’ll keep fighting to protect families in Nevada and across the country."
"Nevada, get out and caucus today!"
"Had a great time with @JulianCastro chatting with voters at @TacosElGordo_! Nevada, remember to get out and caucus!"

"I want every person who pitches in a few bucks to our campaign to know: I’m deeply grateful for you. Together, we’re building a movement to put power in the hands of the people. Chip in now to keep up the momentum."
Families are struggling to get by. They just want a chance—for themselves and for their kids. @JulianCastro and I are fighting to make sure every family has a chance to thrive.
"Thank you, @GavinGrimmVA. I’m deeply grateful for your endorsement, and I will fight alongside you so that LGBTQ+ kids feel safe and supported."
"We can build a country where everyone has a chance to thrive if we dream big and fight hard—together. Let’s go, Nevada!"
"Twelve years after the financial crash, working families are still struggling to get by. Wages have barely budged, while the costs of housing, child care, and health care are soaring. We need to build an economy that works for working families in Nevada and across the country."
"Millions of children could lose their health care coverage because of the Trump administration's cruel public charge rule. Families shouldn't be forced to choose between staying in our country or ensuring their kids get health care. As president, I'll roll back this policy."
"Donald Trump's expanded Muslim Ban is now in effect.

But the Muslim Ban didn't come out of nowhere—it builds on existing policies that have targeted Muslim communities for years.

We must confront the deep-seated anti-Muslim racism in our society and in our policies."
I think there’s a 50/50 chance that Donald Trump looks at debating me and doesn’t even show up. He ain’t that brave.
I always recommend a good cardigan!
"Thank you, @calculizer—I’m so grateful to have you on #TeamWarren!"
"I opposed Las Vegas’s harmful law that criminalizes homelessness. We are facing a housing crisis across this country. That's why I've got a plan to invest in real, federal resources to help build or rehab more than 3 million homes across the country."
We're going live from our Las Vegas event with @JulianCastro!
"Like I said yesterday, Mike Bloomberg and his company should issue a blanket waiver so anyone who wants to come forward can come forward, with or without Bloomberg's prior permission."
"Thank you, Gina! I’m so grateful to have you and Briar on #TeamWarren. Keep persisting!"
"After the 2008 financial crash, I held hearings in Nevada with families who were losing their homes. I fought to hold banks accountable and protect homeowners—and as president, I'll fight so that families in Nevada and across the country have a safe and affordable place to live."
"I've fought for years for real accountability for Wells Fargo and its executives. This is a small step in the right direction, but it's not a substitute for holding senior executives individually accountable—and bringing criminal charges against them if the evidence justifies it."
"Congratulations on your first vote as a U.S. citizen, @DreamElder! Humbled that you put your trust behind me. I promise to fight for you—and for all immigrant youth—as hard as I fight for my family. And we’ll do it together."
"I’m so grateful to have @KathyKLTran on #TeamWarren! This is how we’ll build the movement for big, structural change—together."

"As the first woman, and first Latina, to serve as chief executive of a Texas county home to 5 million people, @LinaHidalgoTX knows what it’s like to fight her heart out for the future Americans deserve. I’m deeply grateful for her endorsement!"
"Puerto Rico needs debt relief—and they need it now. I have been in this fight since before I ran for president, and I will fight for Puerto Rico as president of the United States."
"These comments are horrifying, and the attitude they reflect directly leads to the violence that trans people face.

We will not defeat Trump by undermining the dignity and safety of LGBTQ+ Americans—and someone who does cannot be the leader of our party."
"As the 2008 financial crisis was unfolding, I got a call from @SenatorReid asking me to lead the Congressional Oversight Panel. We've been partners in the fight to protect consumers ever since."
"I stand with the people of McFarland, California. No town should have to live in a state of constant fear. We need to close private detention centers like this GEO facility and invest in rural farm worker communities."
"I told Priyanka: Yes, it really is me! She chipped in $10 after the #DemDebate so I gave her a call to say thank you. We’re in this fight together, Priyanka—and we got this."
"It was great talking to Christopher and his husband, Ryan! They chipped in a few bucks to our campaign and helped us reach our fundraising goal before the Nevada caucuses.

I couldn’t be more grateful. Donate $2 or more now—and I could call you next!"
"I'm going to fight like hell to build a country that works for everyone.

Watch our new Colorado ad. And if you're a Colorado voter, remember to mail in your ballot!"
"Bigotry and hatred towards immigrants is growing around the world, with deadly consequences. We have a responsibility to step up and fight back. My administration will work with our international partners to fight the spread of white supremacist violence."
"You never give up on someone else, because that’s what being a teacher is all about. #CNNTownHall"
Immigration does not make our country weaker—immigration makes our country stronger. #CNNTownHall
It should worry all of us that we now live in an America where one political party seems to think that foreign interference helps them in an election. That makes the challenge we face enormous. It's up to the voters to make sure Democrats win big in November. #CNNTownHall
It's time for a #WealthTax in America. #CNNTownHall
"I’m grateful to everyone who tuned in to my #CNNTownHall tonight. 

Let’s keep the momentum going. Will you chip in $2 before midnight? $12 million before the Nevada caucuses is our most ambitious goal yet—but I know we can do it together."
"Our campaign is bigger and stronger now because we have people working on it from @JulianCastro and @KamalaHarris's campaign. We have people who worked with @CoryBooker, @GovernorBullock, and @JayInslee. That's how we build a strong, inclusive campaign. #CNNTownHall"
"I want to tell you exactly the kind of vice president I want: Someone who will be in this fight alongside me for your families. Someone who feels this fight passionately—and who brings his, her, or their own energy to get it done. #CNNTownHall"
"Never give up.

That’s what being a teacher is all about. No matter how hard it gets, no matter how steep the road looks, no matter how many times it doesn’t look like it’s moving forward, you just don’t give up. #CNNTownHall"
"What kind of an America do we want to be?

Do we want to be an America where 2 cents goes to millionaires and billionaires just to get richer? Or do we want to use that money to invest in an entire generation?

That's how we build a future in America. #CNNTownHall"

"Thank you @MiFamiliaVota for welcoming @JulianCastro and me! I'll fight to build a humane immigration system that reflects our best values, and build a government and economy that works for Latino and immigrant families across the country."
"Russia is interfering in our election again to help elect Trump.

After members of Congress were briefed about this threat, Trump fired the acting Director of National Intelligence.

Trump is shredding the rule of law—and the integrity of our democracy."
"We’re not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who silences women with nondisclosure agreements. 

We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who supported racist policies like stop-and-frisk.

We are not going to beat Donald Trump with another arrogant billionaire."
"It's time to put power in the hands of the people—and that means strengthening and empowering our unions. I've led the effort to end so-called ""right-to-work"" laws, and as president, I'll make sure it's quick and easy to join a union."
"Since I stepped on the #DemDebate stage, our grassroots campaign has raised more than $5 million. We’ve not only reached our critical goal of raising $7 million before the Nevada caucuses—we're now raising it to $12 million. I'm so grateful. Keep it up!"
We choose hope over fear. We choose courage over cynicism. I’m proud to partner with @AyannaPressley in this fight.
I’m so proud to have @AlenciaJohnson on my team!
Trans athletes are not a threat. We need to protect trans kids—and all LGBTQ+ kids—and ensure they feel safe and welcomed at school. I urge the Arizona legislature to reject this cruel bill.
State legislators like @CindyPoloFL103 are fighting hard to protect our reproductive rights from right-wing ideologues. I'll fight alongside them and push for federal laws that protect reproductive care in every state.
"I was humbled to be on @LatinoUSA. The fight to defeat Donald Trump must include Latino, Latina, and Latinx voices—and I’m determined to continue listening and learning from the community. Thank you for having me, @Maria_Hinojosa!"
"Too often, Black moms feel ignored, terrified, and discriminated against while giving birth. All of this contributes to the Black maternal mortality crisis we face. It's time to tackle this crisis head-on, and I've got a plan for that."
This country has worked for the rich and powerful for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt. It's time to have a president who will be on the side of working families and will fight for them. I'm not afraid to fight back. That is how I will beat Donald Trump. #DemDebate
"Thank you, @AliciaGarza and @BlackToTheFutu1! I’m deeply grateful for your endorsement. I will continue to listen and learn from you, and I ask that you continue to hold me accountable as we fight together for big, structural change."
"I am deeply humbled by this endorsement, and I’m proud to partner with @BlackToTheFutu1 to build a country and a government that works for Black families and communities across the country."
We’re running out of time before the Nevada caucuses. Will you pitch in $2 right now and get in the fight?
"Mike Bloomberg got a number of women—who knows how many—to sign non-disclosure agreements for sexual harassment and gender discrimination.

He needs to release the women from the non-disclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story. Watch our new ad."
"Just got some great news after the #DemDebate: Today is officially our campaign’s best fundraising day ever.

We’re very close to hitting our $7 million fundraising goal before the Nevada caucuses. Will you chip in $2 right now?"
I'll fight for your family just as hard as I've fought for my own. #DemDebate

I'll fight for your family just as hard as I've fought for my own. #DemDebate
I want to make sure that environmental justice gets more than a passing mention. I have made a commitment to invest a trillion dollars to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to be inflicted on communities of color. We have to own up to our responsibility. #DemDebate
"Of all the people on the #DemDebate stage, I’ve been a politician the shortest—but I've been the one out fighting for families the longest. As President, I'll fight for your family as hard as I fight for mine. #DemDebate"
This is not just a question of Mike Bloomberg’s character—it’s a question about electability. We’re not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who silences women with who knows how many nondisclosure agreements. #DemDebate
"I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage and got some good news from my team: We’re getting closer to our fundraising goal of $7 million before the Nevada caucuses on Saturday.

Chip in $2 and I could give you a call tomorrow to say thanks."
"I grew up in Oklahoma. I grew up fighting.

I watched when my dad had a heart attack, when our car was lost, when we were on the edge of losing our home. I watched my mother fight to save our family. And I grew up fighting to save our family. #DemDebate"
"A majority of Americans—Democrats, independents, and Republicans—support my #WealthTax on all fortunes above $50 million. #DemDebate"
"This is a question of values. Do we want to invest in Mayor Bloomberg, or in an entire generation of young people? #DemDebate"
"With my #WealthTax, we can afford:

✅ Universal Child Care and universal pre-k
✅ Raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher
✅ Put $800 billion into our public schools
✅ $50 billion into our HBCUs and more"
This presidential race is about leadership and accountability. Mike Bloomberg needs a different apology. #DemDebate
There’s a startup gap between white entrepreneurs and Latino entrepreneurs. The principal reason is that Latino entrepreneurs don’t have the equity to get businesses started. I have a plan to put $7 billion in a fund to help people who are routinely cut out. #DemDebate
"The end of redlining didn't cause the 2008 crash. Out-of-control greed by big banks—and the corruption that lets them control our government—caused the crash. We need to confront the shameful legacy of discrimination, not lie about it like Mike Bloomberg has done. #DemDebate"
"We can't simply talk about climate change in big, global terms. We have to own up to our responsibility. We need to talk about it in terms of rescuing the communities that have been damaged. #DemDebate"
The question of environmental justice should get more than a glancing blow in this #DemDebate. I have a commitment of a trillion dollars to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to inflict on Black and Brown communities for generations.
"Let’s be clear: We need to get rid of the filibuster. If you're not willing to roll back the filibuster, then you're giving the fossil fuel industry a veto. #DemDebate"
Why can't we get anything passed in Washington on climate? Corruption. The first thing I want to do as president is pass my anti-corruption bill so we can start making changes and stand up to the fossil fuel industry. #DemDebate
"I believe in science.

And I believe that one way we're going to deal with the climate crisis is by increasing by tenfold our investment in science. I have a plan for that. #DemDebate"
"On my first day as president, I will sign an executive order to stop all new drilling and mining on public lands and offshore drilling. We cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits. #DemDebate"
"While Mike Bloomberg was blaming Blacks and Latinos for the 2008 financial crisis, I was holding hearings with families in Nevada who were losing their homes. I have a record of fighting for working families—and winning. #DemDebate"

Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story? #DemDebate"

That just doesn’t cut it. #DemDebate"
"If you want to issue a real apology, then it has to start with the racist intent of the plan, and the willful ignorance of admitting what was happening even as people protested in your own streets. You need a different apology here, Mr. Mayor. #DemDebate"
"This is about leadership and accountability. When Mayor Bloomberg apologizes for stop and frisk, he talks about how it turned out. The problem is what it was designed to do to begin with: Target communities of color and Black and Brown men from the start. #DemDebate"
Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. It's time to have a president who is on the side of working families—and is willing to get out there and fight for them. #DemDebate
"I met a man in Reno with diabetes who gets his insulin through the VA. His sister and daughter also have diabetes—and no way to pay for it.

Three human beings right here in Nevada—sharing one insulin prescription.

That should not happen in America. #MedicareForAll #DemDebate"
You can't stand on the #DemDebate stage and trash #MedicareForAll without a realistic plan of your own. And if you're not going to own up to the fact that you don't have a plan—or that your plan will leave people without full coverage—then you need to say so. #DemDebate
"Health care is a crisis in this country. My approach is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible. To bring in as many supporters as we can. If we don't get it all the first time, we take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more. #MedicareForAll"
"Wall Street tried to stop us. 
I won, they lost. 

We’re not going to beat Donald Trump with a candidate who makes excuses for the powerful. We need a candidate who has shown they can fight them—and win. #DemDebate"

"While Mike Bloomberg was blaming Black and Latino families for the 2008 crash, I was in Nevada—literally down the street from where we’re standing tonight—holding hearings on how Wall Street was ripping homes away from millions of people. #DemDebate"

"Nevada, you still have time to vote early before the caucuses this Saturday!"
"Donald Trump has done serious damage to our government, and our next president is going to have to work hard to rebuild it.

"Mike Bloomberg approved and oversaw a program that surveilled and tracked Muslim communities in mosques, restaurants, and even college campuses—leaving permanent damage. He refuses to apologize for it."

"As the first woman—the first Latina—to be elected mayor of Tucson, Arizona, @TucsonRomero has been breaking barriers her entire life. She knows the American dream is slipping further away, and I’m humbled to partner with her in this fight for big, structural change."
It’s a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate. But at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire.
"Domestic workers have led the fight for economic justice—from the Atlanta washerwomen’s strike, to Dorothy Bolden and the National Domestic Workers Union of America, to @DomesticWorkers leading the fight now. I look forward to joining their #DignityUnityPower forum today!"
Proud to partner with @Benny_Starr in this fight!
"Mike Bloomberg's expansion of “stop and frisk” devastated Black and Brown communities. For years, he used racist justifications to defend the practice—and more comments are already resurfacing. We need a nominee that Democratic voters can trust."
"This grassroots movement isn't just about defeating Donald Trump. Big, structural change means winning up and down the ticket. That's why I'm proudly endorsing candidates fighting to put power in the hands of the people."
"These are frightening times. People are afraid for their friends, their family, their neighbors. Yet they still have so much optimism that we can defeat Donald Trump and build a better country. They give me hope and fuel this fight. Thank you so much, Reno!"
"Families just want a chance to succeed—to build a good life for themselves and their kids. I hear that everywhere, from the Broadacres Market in Las Vegas, to communities across the country. We need to ensure our country and economy work for them—not just a thin slice at the top."
This is how we’ll do this—together!
"I don’t accept contributions from:

✖️ PACs 
✖️ Federal lobbyists
✖️ Big Oil executives
✖️ Big Pharma executives
✖️ Big Tech executives 
✖️ Big Bank executives

We’re doing this the grassroots way—person by person. Will you chip in $3 before midnight?"
Let’s do this!
Yes we will!
"Thank you so much, I’m so grateful for your support!"
Woo-hoo!
"Thank you, @PattyArquette, I’m grateful to have you on #TeamWarren!"
"When I meet young girls on the campaign trail, I tell them, ""I'm Elizabeth Warren, and I'm running for president because that's what girls do."" Then we pinkie promise so they remember.

I can't wait for a #PresidentsDay not too long from now, when they're all running, too!"
.@CRoadCore did such a phenomenal job with this illustration. I am beyond grateful for her work.
"AAPI communities include nearly 50 diverse racial and ethnic groups, yet the aggregated data we collect hides that some AAPI families are hanging on by their fingernails. This is a civil rights issue, and I've got a plan to fix it."
"Had a wonderful time joining the @ClarkDems for the Kick-Off to Caucus Gala!

Nevada, you still have time to vote early before the caucuses this Saturday. Here's everything you need to know:"
Thank you for my “Happy Presidents’ Day” card—I love it!

"I’m humbled by @CRoadCore’s thoughtful design. Her work embodies the insight and tenacity that Latinas bring to this fight, and I am so grateful for her decision to collaborate with #TeamWarren. Cristy, I hope I can make you proud as president of the United States."
Dreamers like Alejandra make our communities stronger. I'll fight to make sure Alejandra and every Dreamer in our country has an achievable path to citizenship.
"I don’t take these endorsements lightly. I will partner with these powerful Latina women in the fight for big, structural change—and I will continue to listen and learn from the community every step of the way. I ask you all to hold me accountable to this promise."
Donald Trump has been abusing our immigration system to cause tremendous harm to immigrant families. I'm proud to work with @JayesGreenJ to build a humane immigration system that reflects our best values.

"We set an ambitious goal to raise $7 million before the Nevada caucuses—and this grassroots community is stepping up. I'm grateful down to my toes, and if you chip in $5 or whatever you can today to help hit this goal, I could call you to say thanks!"
"I loved meeting families in Las Vegas Chinatown, including many first-time voters and caucusgoers. Thanks for showing me around, @MaryLouAkai—and recommending we grab boba!"
"Families in Las Vegas, Nevada, and all across the country are ready to fight for big, structural change. #NVertheless, we persist."
"Courtney from Texas donated $5 to our campaign and said she believes in me. Well, I believe in Courtney—and over 1 million others who've chipped in a few bucks to keep our movement strong. We can only do this together—will you chip in $5 now?"

Emily asked me why it's important for women to run for president. Here's my answer.
"Self-funding billionaires like Mike Bloomberg who are running for president don’t have to think about fundraising goals—but we do.

We need to raise $7 million before the Nevada caucuses, and we’re doing it person by person. Will you chip in $3 right now?"
"My heart aches for the children and young adults like Kevin who are being harmed and traumatized by our immigration system. They deserve so much better. This is unethical, cruel, and inhumane—and this will stop in a Warren administration."
"It was so good to finally meet you in person, @YNB! Thanks for joining us in Nevada. This is how we’ll do this—together."
"Here's something that shouldn't be controversial to say: I believe in science. I believe that climate change threatens every single living thing on this planet, and that we need to act now to defeat this crisis."

See you tomorrow!
"Kyle, a nurse from New York, had never donated to a presidential campaign before—until he pitched in $5 to my campaign this week. I called Kyle to say thank you, and I’m so glad he picked up!

Will you chip in $5 for the first time, too?"
"Thank you so much for walking me around @BroadacresMEC, @EdgarFloresNV! I’m proud to partner with you to ensure that every Nevada family has the opportunity to thrive."
"I'm proud to partner with you in this fight, @JamilahLemieux!"

Tell her I say thank you for her work. This is how we’re going to do it—together.
"Thank you for volunteering this week, Guillermo!"
"Giant corporations have proven they’d rather cut corners and push consumers into fighting each other than lose even a penny in profits—and that’s why we’re fighting for big, structural change."
"Mike Bloomberg is a billionaire who thinks he can drop a bunch of money and buy an election.

I believe in grassroots funding, grassroots organizing, and grassroots democracy. If you think this is the right way to campaign, chip in and join us:"
"This dangerous bill would separate families, scapegoat immigrant communities, and pit Arizonans against each other. I stand with the activists and organizations fighting to stop SCR1007."
"Let's go, Nevada! Early voting is happening now, and the caucuses are only a week away. No matter where you live, here's how you can help."
"This grassroots movement raised more than $1 million in less than 24 hours—so we were able to expand our TV ads in Nevada!

Chip in $5 or whatever you can now to help us spread our message in Nevada, South Carolina, and Super Tuesday states:"
I was proud to fight beside @SenatorReid and @BarackObama to protect consumers—and I'll keep fighting to protect consumers as president of the United States. Watch our new ad airing in Nevada now.
"Oh no, I’m sorry we missed each other! Thank you again for being part of our grassroots movement."
"This is a totally unnecessary escalation that is only intended to intimidate our cities and increase fear in immigrant communities. We must end the cruel, inhumane policies of the Trump administration."

Enough is enough. We have to end the opioid epidemic and ensure that everyone gets the treatment they need. And we must root out the greed and corruption that has fueled this crisis.
"Lizzy from Massachusetts chipped in a few bucks to our campaign—so I called to say thanks. I told Lizzy and her daughter, Annie, that I’m fighting for them. The only way we’ll make real change is by doing it together. Chip in now and I could call you next!"
"February 14 was my mother's birthday, and she loved her special connection to Valentine’s Day. Every year, I make a heart-shaped cake to remember her. Here's why."
"I gave Aurora from Ohio a call tonight to thank her for chipping in to our campaign. I’m grateful for supporters like her who pitch in a few bucks to grow our movement. 

Thank you, Aurora. Your fight is our fight."
Profit-sharing is an important and valuable benefit. I stand with the workers organizing with @afa_cwa for a union contract that protects this and all of their other hard-earned benefits!
"These homophobic attacks against @PeteButtigieg are hateful and offensive. We will not tolerate this in the Democratic presidential race, and we will fight together against the hate and bigotry that Donald Trump promotes and rewards."
"Thank you for moderating this discussion, @FredTJoseph and @Benny_Starr. I don’t take these conversations lightly. I’m committed to keep listening and learning from Black men and their experiences as we fight for justice, opportunity, and respect. Your voices are critical."

"It was so good to see you and your family last night, @ElenaHung202! Thanks for being a part of this grassroots movement."
"The energy last night in Virginia was incredible—and this grassroots movement is only growing stronger. Help us keep building this momentum. Chip in to help meet our ambitious $7 million goal before the Nevada caucuses, and I might call you to say thanks!"
"Thanks for joining me in Virginia last night, @MattBC!

We’re celebrating love today, so here’s my promise to you and @CosetTheTable: I'll keep fighting so that no one is forced to choose between critical benefits and marrying the person they love."
"Thank you, @Angela_Lang. I’m so grateful to have you on #TeamWarren!"
We are watching a descent into authoritarianism and the shredding of the rule of law. Congress must act immediately to rein in our lawless Attorney General—and the American people will hold Donald Trump accountable in November.
We will not allow Donald Trump to drag us into another endless war. I'm proud to stand with @TimKaine on this important resolution.
"Happy Valentine’s Day, @AyannaPressley! I couldn’t imagine a better gift than having you on this team."

Refusing to catalogue paid political ads because the Bloomberg campaign found a workaround means there will be less transparency for the content he is paying to promote. Mike Bloomberg cannot be allowed to buy an election with zero accountability.

The 2008 financial crash would not have been averted if we had allowed the banks to be more racist. And anyone who thinks otherwise should not be the leader of our party.
"I’m deeply grateful for your endorsement, @ChaseStrangio. I don’t take it lightly—and I ask you to hold me accountable as we partner in this fight for big, structural change."
"Yesterday, we announced our most ambitious fundraising goal yet: $7 million before the Nevada caucuses.

If you can help and chip in tonight, we’ll be well on our way. Will you pitch in $3 now?"
"Those who testified today are incredibly brave. Fast food workers need and deserve the job security to be able to speak up about sexual harassment or an abusive boss, organize with co-workers, or ask for a raise or a schedule change. We need to protect and empower their voices."
"I’m ready to fight for you, Virginia! Let’s do this."
I believe that you measure what you care about—and I care about building a government that works for everyone in the diverse AAPI community.
"Tuesday was AAPI Women's Equal Pay Day. AAPI women as a whole are paid 90 cents on every dollar earned by white men. But Native Hawaiian women make 63 cents, Samoan women make 62 cents, and Fijian women make just 55 cents on the dollar."
"Here's just one example: Income inequality in Asian American communities nearly doubled from 1970 to 2016. Burmese, Nepalese, Hmong, and Bangladeshi Americans make, on average, less than half what people in some other AAPI communities make."
"The AAPI community includes nearly 50 diverse racial and ethnic groups, but the data we gather today doesn’t capture significant differences on key economic and social outcomes. Data equity is a civil rights issue—and I've got a plan for that."
We need to confront the racist legacy of redlining head-on. My housing plan creates a first-of-its-kind down-payment assistance program to help families living in formerly redlined neighborhoods buy a home.
"The Trump administration is refusing to allow grieving parents to visit their remaining daughter. The Muslim Ban is cruel, and it's time for it to go. Congress must pass the No Ban Act."
"I will provide a path to citizenship for the 1.7 million undocumented #AAPIs, expand family reunification, and roll back harmful policies like Trump’s Public Charge rule, which prevents children from having access to critical services. #AAPI2020"
I’ll use every tool to fight hate crimes. I'll rebuild trust with targeted communities by working with community leaders and directing the CDC to research white nationalism. And my DOJ will prioritize combatting white nationalist violence. #AAPI2020
"From rising seas to lingering effects of nuclear testing, Pacific Islanders face dangers of climate change firsthand. As president, I'll remediate historic injustices for frontline communities by prioritizing at least $1 trillion in climate investments."
"AAPI Americans’ voices will be crucial in 2020. My plan would guarantee the fundamental right to vote, ensure racist and corrupt politicians don’t undermine that right, and improve voting accessibility for LEP voters. #AAPI2020"
"The student loan crisis is crushing a generation. Enough is enough: Starting on day one of my presidency, I’ll cancel student debt for 95% of Americans who have it. Then, we’ll make public colleges, which over 80% of AAPI students attend, free—no tuition or fees. #AAPI2020"
"My goal as president, and our goal as a society, will be to reduce gun deaths by 80%—and I have a plan to get it done. #AAPI2020"
"We have a gun violence epidemic in this country. We need to act—now. I will break the NRA’s stranglehold on Congress and sign comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation into law in my first 100 days, and keep improving on it every year. #AAPI2020"
We need expanded legal immigration that will grow our economy and reunite families. We need to provide due process to migrants. I’ll eliminate the use of expedited removal proceedings and fight for a national immigration public defender corps. #AAPI2020
"Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. We need to build a fair, humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan for that."
The 2008 financial crash would not have been averted if we had allowed the banks to be more racist. And anyone who thinks otherwise should not be the leader of our party.

We need to confront the racist legacy of redlining head-on. My housing plan creates a first-of-its-kind down-payment assistance program to help families living in formerly redlined neighborhoods buy a home.
"The Trump administration is refusing to allow grieving parents to visit their remaining daughter. The Muslim Ban is cruel, and it's time for it to go. Congress must pass the No Ban Act."
"I will provide a path to citizenship for the 1.7 million undocumented #AAPIs, expand family reunification, and roll back harmful policies like Trump’s Public Charge rule, which prevents children from having access to critical services. #AAPI2020"
I’ll use every tool to fight hate crimes. I'll rebuild trust with targeted communities by working with community leaders and directing the CDC to research white nationalism. And my DOJ will prioritize combatting white nationalist violence. #AAPI2020
"From rising seas to lingering effects of nuclear testing, Pacific Islanders face dangers of climate change firsthand. As president, I'll remediate historic injustices for frontline communities by prioritizing at least $1 trillion in climate investments."
"AAPI Americans’ voices will be crucial in 2020. My plan would guarantee the fundamental right to vote, ensure racist and corrupt politicians don’t undermine that right, and improve voting accessibility for LEP voters. #AAPI2020"
"The student loan crisis is crushing a generation. Enough is enough: Starting on day one of my presidency, I’ll cancel student debt for 95% of Americans who have it. Then, we’ll make public colleges, which over 80% of AAPI students attend, free—no tuition or fees. #AAPI2020"
"My goal as president, and our goal as a society, will be to reduce gun deaths by 80%—and I have a plan to get it done. #AAPI2020"
"We have a gun violence epidemic in this country. We need to act—now. I will break the NRA’s stranglehold on Congress and sign comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation into law in my first 100 days, and keep improving on it every year. #AAPI2020"
We need expanded legal immigration that will grow our economy and reunite families. We need to provide due process to migrants. I’ll eliminate the use of expedited removal proceedings and fight for a national immigration public defender corps. #AAPI2020
"Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. We need to build a fair, humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan for that."
"I will strengthen protections for English Language Learners in schools, make elections more accessible to Limited English Proficiency voters, and reverse Trump's shameful proposal to roll back health care non-discrimination protections for LEP people under Section 1557. #AAPI2020"
"I’ll form a White House Task Force on data equity to make sure that no one in the AAPI community is erased. We’ll work with AAPI communities to collect comprehensive, disaggregated data in key federal surveys and across agencies. #AAPI2020"
"Data equity is a civil rights issue. AAPI people are not a monolith, and aggregated data hides the fact that many AAPI families are hanging on by their fingernails. Data erasure limits our abilities to tackle the structural barriers faced by distinct AAPI communities. #AAPI2020"
"I will build a cabinet and senior leadership team that reflects the full diversity of America’s communities. I will diversify recruitment for government jobs, including directing resources toward attracting applicants from minority-serving institutions. #AAPI2020"
"We need to staff our government with people who deeply understand the intersectional needs and experiences of all Americans—from housing to health care—and who reflect the diversity of the American people, and that includes Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. #AAPI2020"
Personnel is policy. I’m proud to have the first Asian American campaign manager of any major presidential campaign. I’ve pledged to appoint a diverse cabinet. I’ll listen to and learn from AAPI leaders who have been at the forefront of advocating for their communities. #AAPI2020
"Learn more about my platform at the #AAPI2020 Twitter Town Hall, happening soon at 2 PM ET—and join the conversation using the hashtag #AAPI2020."
"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing minority group in the U.S. today—working hard to thrive, but still facing unique barriers to achieving their dreams. I'm a fighter for working families—and committed to fighting for AAPI families."
"Here’s a history lesson on the racist legacy of redlining, if any presidential candidate needs a refresher."
"If we want to build a government and a country that works for everyone, we need to tackle generations of racial injustice and systemic discrimination head on. I’ll listen to and learn from the AAPI leaders who have been at the forefront of this fight."
We need to take concrete steps to address the impact of redlining and the subprime mortgage crisis. I built an office at the @CFPB to fight lending discrimination and my housing plan helps families in formerly redlined areas to buy homes and build wealth.
"The end of redlining didn't cause the 2008 crash. Out-of-control greed by Wall Street and big banks, and the corruption that lets them control our government, caused the crash. Predatory lenders steered families of color into the worst loans and those families lost billions."
"I'm surprised that someone running for the Democratic nomination thinks the economy would be better off if we just let banks be more overtly racist. We need to confront the shameful legacy of discrimination, not lie about it like Mike Bloomberg has done."
"Thank you, Smitha! I’m thankful to have your support!"
"I deeply appreciate your support, Erika!"
"Thank you, Marshall. I’m deeply grateful."
"Scarlett, I’m grateful. This is how we’re going to do this: Together."
"Thank you, Saira! I’m with you, too."
And I believe in you! Thank you.
"Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Colette."

"David Adame-Reyes was arrested for sitting on a sidewalk, then sent to immigration detention. This is cruel and unjust. Immigration and law enforcement should be kept separate—combining them only sows distrust and harms public safety."
I look forward to joining the #AAPI2020 Twitter Town Hall tomorrow!
"No one should attack @Culinary226 and its members for fighting hard for themselves and their families. Like them, I want to see every American get high-quality and affordable health care—and I’m committed to working with them to achieve that goal."
"I'll be on @AllInWithChris shortly to talk about how we're building our grassroots movement to power through Nevada, South Carolina, Super Tuesday, and beyond. Tune in!"
"A third of delegates aren't decided until Super Tuesday. What we do now matters.

Our campaign needs critical funds to reach voters and caucus-goers, so we’ve set an ambitious goal: $7 million before the Nevada caucuses.

Will you chip in $5 or more now?"
"From day one, this fight has been the same. Our government and our economy are working better and better for a thinner slice at the top—at the expense of everyone else. We need big, structural change to make them work for everyone."
"Gutting funding for clean energy isn't just bad for our climate—it kills jobs. If we want to fight climate change and create good union jobs, we need to invest in clean energy."
"Zaya is a remarkable young woman with such an insight on life. Bruce, I, and our entire team are inspired by her. We’re sending all our love and support. Thank you for being such incredible parents—I know that’s the future you want for all our kids."
"We will win by uniting our country around ending the corruption that has shortchanged our kids, our schools, and the very survival of our planet."
"This fight to save our democracy is an uphill battle. But our campaign is built for the long haul, and we are just getting started. We have the hope that comes with dreaming big—and the courage to fight for the big, structural change we need."
"Americans of all political stripes should be gravely concerned about the corruption that pressures federal prosecutors to give sweetheart deals to criminals who do their crimes on behalf of Donald Trump.

Yes Roger Stone, I’m looking at you."
"Thank you, @DevalPatrick. I know that we will continue fighting together for Massachusetts families, and for working families all across our country."
"Abusing official power to protect political friends and attack opponents is common in authoritarian regimes like Putin’s Russia. Trump and Barr’s conduct has no place in our democracy. To end it, Congress must act—and the American people must hold them accountable in November."
I am the only candidate to propose an independent DOJ task force to investigate crimes by Trump administration officials. Every Democratic candidate must commit to it—so Trump officials know they will be held accountable by career prosecutors once he is out of office.
"Congress must act immediately to rein in our lawless Attorney General. Barr should resign or face impeachment. And Congress should use spending power to defund the AG’s authority to interfere with anything that affects Trump, his friends, or his elections."
Donald Trump can continue his corrupt rampages and vendettas because elected Republicans do nothing. They lack the courage and backbone shown by four career prosecutors who stepped down rather than facilitate the Attorney General’s corrupt scheme. But we are not powerless.
Donald Trump is shredding the rule of law in this country. His AG overruled career prosecutors to reduce the sentence for his buddy Roger Stone after Stone committed crimes to protect him. Every Republican who voted to acquit Trump for his corrupt actions enabled and owns this.
"We’re staying in this fight for the people who are counting on us. Tomorrow morning, we’ll wake up and fight twice as hard—together. Chip in $5 and let’s do this:"
"A young girl came up to me tonight and said, “I’m a broke college student with a lot of student loan debt. I checked and I have $6 in the bank—so I just gave $3 to keep you in this fight.” We’re staying in this fight for the people who are counting on us."

It's no coincidence that this sentencing change follows the president's tweet this morning. Donald Trump's administration is filled with corruption—and we must root it out.

"Thank you @WeDemandJustice, @ReproRights, @NARAL, and @AllAboveAllAct for hosting #OurRightsOurCourts this weekend on the power of the courts. We need to put power in the hands of the people and ensure government works for everyone, not just billionaires and giant corporations."
"San Antonio: I hope you’ll join @_MariaCMartinez and @CastroCountry as they host a community conversation to discuss the importance of Latinos, Latinas, and Latinx people in our fight to defeat Donald Trump."
"The opioid epidemic is crushing communities across the country. My plan to end this crisis starts with providing $100 billion in federal funding to communities like Bethlehem, New Hampshire on the front lines to make sure every person gets the treatment they need."
"If we want to have a real future in this country, we must invest in our kids. That's why I'm fighting for Universal Child Care and high-quality public education—so that every child has the opportunity to thrive."
"Under the Trump administration, we have seen appointees who are actively hostile to the mission of their agencies. That won't happen in my administration."
"We can let fear consume us and divide us—or we can find the courage to come together and fight back. Me? I’m fighting back.

Fighting back is an act of patriotism."
"One year in, I’m more optimistic than ever about what we can do together. We’re building a grassroots movement that will make big, structural change across the country. Help our campaign keep up the momentum:"
"We launched this grassroots movement for big, structural change one year ago today. More than 100,000 selfies, over 200 town halls, and more than one million individual grassroots donors later, this movement keeps growing. Let's dream big, fight hard, and win!"
"Anwar is a photographer who volunteered with his local fire department. The Trump administration deported him—without a chance to see his attorney or say goodbye to his family—to war-torn Yemen, where he fears for his life. We must end this cruelty."
"I've been winning unwinnable fights my whole life, from fighting to create the CFPB to unseating an incumbent Republican.

Everyone thinks they know what fights are unwinnable, until we get in the fight, persist—and win. That’s what I’m going to do."
"Abortion rights are human rights.
Abortion rights are economic rights.
And I will never stop fighting to defend those rights."
"This moment in history comes to us. You will decide the direction of our country—not for four years, not for eight years—but for generations to come. 

This is our moment to choose hope over fear, courage over cynicism. This is our moment to dream big, fight hard and win."
"Had a fantastic time with the @NHDems at the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner! We face big challenges—but this is our moment in history. Let's choose courage over cynicism, hope over fear."
"And we could cancel student loan debt and have #MedicareForAll too.

Learn more about how my #WealthTax would give every family the opportunity to thrive:"
"With a two-cent #WealthTax, we can make sure that Benjy and every kid in America has free child care, pre-k, a high-quality public education, and universal public two- and four-year public college and technical school."
"Manchester is ready to get out, knock some doors, and make big, structural change. Let’s do this!"
"People are worried that the fight against Donald Trump could be unwinnable. I've been winning unwinnable fights my whole life, from fighting for the CFPB to unseating an incumbent Republican.

Everyone thinks they know what fights are unwinnable, until we fight, persist—and win."
"Bruce and Bailey helped me knock doors today in Manchester! No matter where you live, we need all hands on deck to grow this movement for big, structural change:"
"Thank you, @SenadoraJulie! I’m so grateful to have you on #TeamWarren."

"The daily toll of the opioid epidemic is devastating. Lisa: I'm fighting for your sister, for your family, and for the countless other families missing their loved ones."
We need to re-establish accountability in our country and integrity to our government. I've got a plan for that—and it starts with ensuring the American people learn the full truth of what the Trump administration has done.

"If we want to defeat Donald Trump, we must build a grassroots movement that unites the party. So if you're ready to fight corruption, if you're ready to build a country of our best values, and if you're ready for big, structural change, join us."
"Wages are barely budging, but the costs of housing, health care, education, and child care are exploding. All it takes is one crisis to send families over a financial cliff. We need big, structural change."
"We win by calling out what is broken, showing people how we’re going to fix it, and building a grassroots movement to get it done. 

That’s what this campaign is about—down to its core."
"I'll have a Secretary of Education who's been a public school teacher, who believes in public education, and who believes in fighting for students and teachers—not for-profit institutions and giant corporations.

Betsy DeVos need not apply."
"I’m grateful down to my toes for everyone who tuned in to tonight’s #DemDebate. Together, we’re building a movement to unite our party and put power in the hands of the people.

Will you chip in $3 now to keep up the momentum?"
"People are worried that the fight against Trump is unwinnable. Well, I’ve got a record of winning fights they said were unwinnable—from creating the CFPB to unseating a popular Republican senator. When we fight, when #WePersist, we win! #DemDebate"
"We don’t build a democracy with Super PACS or people sucking up to billionaires. We build it by having a grassroots movement funded from the grassroots up. If you think it's the right way to run a campaign, pitch in five bucks here:"
"With a #WealthTax, we can have Universal Child Care, early childhood education, and pre-k. And we can stop exploiting the people—largely Black and Brown women—who do this work, and raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in America. #DemDebate"

I hear everyone talking about how we all want to overturn Citizens United because we want to end unlimited spending. Everyone on this stage except Amy and me is a billionaire or receiving help from Super PACs. Time to put your money where your mouth is. #DemDebate

Why have we done nothing on gun violence when more than 90% of Americans want us to pass background checks? The reason is corruption. It’s the power of the gun industry and the power of the NRA. We need to attack that corruption head on. #WarrenTownHall

"I'm so grateful for every single person who has joined this grassroots movement for big, structural change. This is how we're going to do it—together."
"Children are dying under our government’s watch. We cannot look away from this humanitarian crisis. As president, I will end this cruelty. #DontLookAway"
"Yesterday, I stopped by to say thank you to a few #TeamWarren volunteers in Des Moines. I'm so proud of our team, and so grateful for every single volunteer who's part of our grassroots movement. Let's do this, Iowa!"
We need all hands on deck! Make calls to Iowa caucusgoers now.
"Thank you, @RebeccaCokley. I’m proud to have you in my corner—and I’ll always be by your side in this fight."
"When I decided to run for president, it was an act of optimism that we could build a country of our best values—and that optimism has only grown. From Indianola, Iowa to all across the country, we’re ready to fight for that brighter future."
"That's a choice no parent should ever have to make. I'm proud to be at your side in this fight, @Nataliew1020. Let's do this."
"It’s going to take all of us to make big, structural change. Text Iowa caucusgoers now."
Are you caucusing tonight in Iowa? Here’s a list of resources to bookmark:
"This is not the time to nibble around the edges of the big problems we face. This is our moment to fight for the big, structural change we need. I'm ready to fight—and in Ames, Iowa, and all across the country, I know our grassroots movement is ready, too!"
"Thank you, Iowa. Over the past year, you've made me a better candidate—and you'll make me a better president."
"I believe we can build an America where everyone is valued.

An America where we invest in every single child.

An America where people—not money—are the most important part of our democracy.

Let's build that America together."
"Today's the day, Iowa. This is our moment to dream big, fight hard, and build big, structural change. I hope you'll stand in my corner tonight!"
"I hope you’ll be in my corner tomorrow night, Iowa! Here’s everything you need to know to caucus."
"The way I see it, fighting for a #WealthTax means fighting to build a country that lives our values. It means asking those at the top to invest in an entire generation—so that everyone has the opportunity to thrive."
"This is a hard moment for our country. But we still have our voices and our votes—and if we use them now and in November, we can restore decency and integrity in Washington."
"Our rural communities and family farmers should have every opportunity to thrive. Wherever you live, I'm fighting to make sure our government and our economy work for you."
"Are you ready, Iowa? Commit to caucus now:"
Who is our government going to work for? Will it work just for the wealthy and well-connected—or will it work for everyone? @AyannaPressley and I are fighting to put power in the hands of the people. I'm so grateful she could join me in Cedar Rapids!
"Trump has been president for three years now, and you can feel the fear across the country. We have a choice to make: Will we let the fear pull us back, or are we going to fight back?

Me, I'm fighting back. Because fighting back is an act of patriotism."
"Over a year since launching this campaign, I'm more optimistic than ever because of our grassroots movement here in Iowa City, and all across the country. It’s made me a better candidate—and you’ll make me a better president."
"Children are dying under our government’s watch. We cannot look away from this humanitarian crisis. As president, I will end this cruelty. #DontLookAway"

"Thank you, @RBraceySherman. I’m committed to protecting the right to a safe, legal abortion and expanding reproductive health care for every American."
"Thank you @wanasattia, I’m so grateful to have you on #TeamWarren!"
"I'm grateful to everyone who got into this presidential race. It's not easy to do, but we all do it for the love of our country. They brought their good ideas, enthusiasm, and talent. Our job as a party is both to say thank you—and to come together to beat Donald Trump."
It’s time to #GOTC in Ames! Tune in for a live look at our rally:
At the core of Donald Trump's presidency and behind so many issues we face in Washington is corruption—plain and simple. And I've got a plan to root it out.
"Woo-hoo! Thank you, @PhillipaSoo! I’m so grateful to have you on #TeamWarren. Together—we’ll make sure this country works for everyone."
"I’m proud to have you in my corner, @JulianCastro!

Text CAUCUS to 24477 to commit to caucus with #TeamWarren on Monday night."
"My decision to run was an enormous act of optimism—a belief in what we could do together. A year later, I’m more optimistic than ever because I believe in the power of the grassroots movement. We will build the America of our future. This is our moment in history."
"Sophie, I’m in this fight for you."
"Love you, Bruce. I couldn't do this without you by my side."
"Two days, Iowa. Let's do this. Get in the fight now:"
"Thank you, @SarahPearr! This is how we’ll win—together."
"Iowa, you have a decision to make. Will we let the fear pull us back—or are we going to fight back?

I'm fighting back. That's why I'm in this race."
I’m excited to join @JulianCastro for our live #GOTC event in Davenport—tune in!
"Thank you, @KeldaHelenRoys! So excited to have you in this fight."
"There are just two days left before the Iowa caucuses! I helped kick off a canvass in Urbandale, Iowa—because it's going to take all of us fighting together to make big, structural change. No matter where you live, you can volunteer and help right now:"
"Mike is done with Donald Trump's broken promises. So this Monday, he'll be caucusing with #TeamWarren and helping us fight to root out Trump's corruption in Washington."
"Two of my brothers are Republicans. But there's more that unites us than divides us. We're outraged by the costs of child care, education, and housing. We're horrified by corruption in Washington. And we're fighting together to build a country that works for us all."
"Representation matters. I’ll ensure that our educator workforce keeps pace with the changing demographics of our schools. That also means investing in identity-affirming curricula, so that students see themselves in their school work—not just one month a year, but all year long."
"Continuing to militarize schools won’t improve school safety. I’ll fight to end zero-tolerance discipline, which disproportionately impacts Black students, and invest in restorative justice programs. I’ll also push to close the mental health provider gap in schools."
"Thank you, @RBraceySherman. I’m committed to protecting the right to a safe, legal abortion and expanding reproductive health care for every American."

"#BlackLivesMatter at school. Every student deserves to learn in a welcoming and safe public school. As president, I’ll ensure that the federal government plays its part in bringing a positive, nurturing climate to every school."
It's so good to be back in Iowa! Thanks to everyone who stayed late to welcome me back to Des Moines last night—and thank you @PeaceTreeBrew for hosting us!
They all voted for different candidates in 2016—and they're all joining @TeamWarren in 2020. This is how we beat Donald Trump—by pulling together a grassroots movement across the country. Watch our New Hampshire ad.
"Thanks to a secret deal between a software company and a major opioid manufacturer, electronic records used by thousands of doctors pushed opioid prescriptions.

This crisis has been driven by greed, pure and simple—and there must be accountability."
"Hey Iowa, @JVN has a special message for you!"
"Innocent civilians are the main casualties of landmines. This is an abhorrent decision that won’t make America any safer, and could cause untold damage. As president, I will reverse this decision and work with our allies to eliminate landmines."
"Families in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and all across the country are ready to fight for big, structural change. Tune in as I join @AyannaPressley for our #GOTC rally."
Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economic and political systems.
"In Iowa and across the country, one thing stands true about this movement we're building together: Over the past year, you've made me a better candidate—and you'll make me a better president."
"This #BlackHistoryMonth, I want to reiterate a promise: When I am president, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons will live in every part of my presidency. And I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day."
"I'm so grateful for each and every one of our grassroots donors! This is how we make big, structural change: together."
Your donation right now would make a direct impact on how many caucusgoers and voters we can reach at this pivotal moment. I wouldn’t ask if it weren’t important—will you pitch in $3 or whatever makes sense for you before midnight?
"I am deeply grateful for these endorsements, and I will fight to make sure that every LGBTQ+ person in America has the opportunity to thrive."
Our January FEC fundraising report will set the tone for the rest of 2020—and we have until midnight to make it as strong as possible. Pitch in $3 or whatever you can to help grow our movement.
"This is what the wealth gap looks like in America today. 

It's time for a #WealthTax so we can invest in opportunities for working families, produce a bigger pie, and cut families a larger slice:"
Thank you @WCruz73! This is how we’re going to do this—together.
"I’m so grateful to have @sdvorsky1 and Bob on #TeamWarren. Together, we’re going to keep fighting for big, structural change."
"Our Campaign Co-Chairs @Deb4CongressNM, @KatiePorterOC, and @AyannaPressley are back in Des Moines to help #GOTC! Tune in at 8:15 PM ET for a live look at our rally!"
"Trump just expanded his racist, xenophobic Muslim Ban to ban 6 more countries—including Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa.

Congress must pass the NO BAN Act. And if they don’t, I’ll reverse the Muslim Ban on the first day of my presidency."
"In this moment of crisis, I know we'll protect our democracy by standing up for ourselves and each other. We have defeated corruption before. We have changed our system together before. And we will do it again."
"#BlackLivesMatter at school. Every student deserves to learn in a welcoming and safe public school. As president, I’ll ensure that the federal government plays its part in bringing a positive, nurturing climate to every school."

The only force that’s powerful enough to stop Trump and the Republicans is us—the American people. They want us to be discouraged and feel hopeless because they're afraid of what will happen when we all come together and take up each other’s fights.
"Senate Republicans have let the American people down, giving Donald Trump permission to conspire with foreign governments to undermine your vote. The GOP has shown where they stand—and it's not with you."
"The DNC didn’t change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. They shouldn’t change the rules to let a billionaire on. Billionaires shouldn't be allowed to play by different rules—on the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government."
"Farmers like Mark have experienced the effects of climate change firsthand, all while Big Ag and Big Oil walk away with giant profits. We need big, structural changes so family farmers like Mark have the opportunity to thrive."
"This is not a time for small ideas. This is a time to fight for big, structural change—but I can’t do it alone. Please chip in $3 or whatever you can before tonight's crucial FEC deadline:"
"This moment is too important to nibble around the edges of the problems we face. Thank you @DMRegister for your endorsement. We need big, structural change—and I'm ready to fight for it. Check out our new Iowa ad."
"Hope over fear.
Courage over cynicism.

I’m fighting for Drew, for Juan, for you, and for everyone in this country. We’re going to do this, @bjoewolf."
"Thank you, @PhilTing! I’m proud to fight beside you to put power in the hands of working people."
"Senate Republicans and the White House should know that the evidence against Trump won't be hidden forever. On day one as president, I will order the release of every document related to this impeachment inquiry that they've been hiding. The people will learn the truth."
"By pushing through a sham trial with no witnesses and no White House documents, they are assisting with his cover-up, and giving him a green light to continue breaking the law. And they've trampled over our Constitution in the process."
"Donald Trump is dangerous and corrupt: He undermined our diplomatic relationships for his personal, political gain. He solicited foreign interference in our elections. Even Republicans have begun to admit it—they simply refuse to hold him accountable for it."
"Donald Trump has deprioritized global health security and cut critical programs like Predict—which can leave us vulnerable to epidemics. As president, I'll bring back Predict and invest in our public health systems to keep us safe from outbreaks like coronavirus."
"In 2016, Stephen caucused for Donald Trump. Now, he's switching parties to caucus for me on Monday. This is how we beat Trump in 2020. Watch our new Iowa ad."
This is our moment in history. We can choose hope over fear and fight to make our country work for working people. But it’s going to take all hands on deck—and that’s why I’m asking: Will you chip in $3 to help grow our movement?
"They all voted for different candidates in 2016—and they're all joining @TeamWarren in 2020. This is how we’re building the grassroots movement that will unite the country and create big, structural change—by bringing people together."
The Iowa caucuses are just three days away—so we got some friends together to talk about what you can do these next few days to help!
"Republicans know that the facts are damning for Donald Trump. If they push through a sham trial to protect him, with no witnesses and no White House documents, they will be assisting with his cover-up, and setting a terrible precedent for the future of our country."
I couldn't do this without incredible people like @FarrellGabriell by my side!
This is shameful. Taxpayer money should be used for programs meant to help American families—not for the personal benefit of Donald Trump’s corrupt administration.
And Trump’s first HHS Secretary still hasn’t repaid taxpayers for the private jets he took while fighting to rip health care from millions by repealing the ACA.
The only force that’s powerful enough to stop Trump and the Republicans is us—the American people. They want us to be discouraged and feel hopeless because they're afraid of what will happen when we all come together and take up each other’s fights.

And Trump’s first HHS Secretary still hasn’t repaid taxpayers for the private jets he took while fighting to rip health care from millions by repealing the ACA.
"The head of Medicaid, Seema Verma, spent millions of taxpayer dollars on consultants to boost her personal image while trying to kick people off Medicaid or significantly cut their coverage."
"The Trump administration took another step to rip health care away from millions. This Medicaid ""healthy opportunity"" plan will leave many sicker and deny them care they need—while Trump administration officials use taxpayer dollars for their own benefit."
"There are four days until the #IACaucus. The critical work we’re doing now—talking with voters, knocking on doors, hosting events—is only possible through grassroots donations. Will you chip in $3 before you log off Twitter tonight?"
"Kerris's family pays $1,200 a month for health insurance, plus $700 more a month for diabetic supplies. If they can't afford that, they're forced to re-use supplies and risk infection.

No one should profit off patients and struggling families. We need #MedicareForAll."
We lose about 100 people a day in America to gun violence—which often falls hardest on Black and Brown communities. My plan to end this epidemic addresses all kinds of gun violence.
"Why are there no resources for essential programs? The wealthy and the well-connected have used their influence in Washington so they can skip out on the bill.

I'm going to make sure our government works for everyone—and pass a #WealthTax so everyone pays their fair share."
"We have a Congress that is being held hostage by the gun industry.

If we want to end the gun violence epidemic, we must fight Washington corruption head-on and eliminate the filibuster."
"We need to decriminalize mental health crises and invest in prevention and treatment services. I'm grateful to @OsopePatrisse for taking the time to talk with me about @ReformLAJails. I'm proud to support Yes on Measure R, and I'll fight for comprehensive criminal justice reform."
This continues to be one of the hardest questions I've ever had to answer. No child should have to go to school afraid for their lives. We must end the gun violence epidemic now.
These airline catering employees work hard every day to bring food to travelers—they should be paid enough to feed their own families. I stand with them in their fight for fair wages and good benefits.
.@ElenaHung202: I'm fighting to make sure that Xiomara and kids across the country with complex medical needs and disabilities can grow up in a world that is accessible and inclusive—because everyone deserves the opportunity to thrive. I'm proud to fight alongside you.
"We know that a small group of corrupt extremists will do everything they can to stop this bill. That's why I've also got a plan to root out the corruption in Washington. Together, we can end the gun violence epidemic that is devastating our communities."
"The #EndGunViolenceBill is supported by @NAACP, @GiffordsCourage, @AMarch4OurLives, @NewtownAction, @StopHandguns, and gun violence prevention, civil rights, public health, and community organizations across the country."
"Our gun violence epidemic is a public health emergency—and we need to make big, structural changes if we want to end it. So today, I introduced the #EndGunViolenceBill in the Senate to confront this crisis head on."
".@foe_us is a leader in our fight to defeat the climate crisis, and I'm deeply grateful for their endorsement. This is the existential threat of our time—and when I'm president, I'll fight for a #GreenNewDeal and a 100% clean energy future."
Our government officials can best serve the American people when they reflect the diversity of the country itself. That's why I'll build a Cabinet and senior leadership team that reflects the full diversity of America.
"Thank you, @One_Colorado! LGBTQ+ Americans should feel free to be who they are and live without fear or discrimination. I won’t stop fighting for them."
"Navient has avoided paying $22 million it owes to the federal government. Now they're asking Betsy DeVos to wipe that debt away. It's absurd. When I'm president, I'll cancel debt for student loan borrowers—not the loan servicers who cheat and abuse them."
"Right now, we have a government that works great for the wealthy and well-connected—at the expense of everyone else.

I'm fighting to make sure we have a government and an economy that works for working families. And I’m proud to fight alongside @WorkingFamilies and @MauriceWFP."
"People told me the CFPB could never happen—but it did. People told me I could never beat a popular Republican incumbent—now he's a former senator. I know how to fight, and I know how to win. Will you chip in $3 to help fund our grassroots campaign?"
"The head of Medicaid, Seema Verma, spent millions of taxpayer dollars on consultants to boost her personal image while trying to kick people off Medicaid or significantly cut their coverage."
"The Trump administration took another step to rip health care away from millions. This Medicaid ""healthy opportunity"" plan will leave many sicker and deny them care they need—while Trump administration officials use taxpayer dollars for their own benefit."
"There are four days until the #IACaucus. The critical work we’re doing now—talking with voters, knocking on doors, hosting events—is only possible through grassroots donations. Will you chip in $3 before you log off Twitter tonight?"
"Kerris's family pays $1,200 a month for health insurance, plus $700 more a month for diabetic supplies. If they can't afford that, they're forced to re-use supplies and risk infection.

No one should profit off patients and struggling families. We need #MedicareForAll."
We lose about 100 people a day in America to gun violence—which often falls hardest on Black and Brown communities. My plan to end this epidemic addresses all kinds of gun violence.
"Why are there no resources for essential programs? The wealthy and the well-connected have used their influence in Washington so they can skip out on the bill.

I'm going to make sure our government works for everyone—and pass a #WealthTax so everyone pays their fair share."
"We have a Congress that is being held hostage by the gun industry.

If we want to end the gun violence epidemic, we must fight Washington corruption head-on and eliminate the filibuster."
"We need to decriminalize mental health crises and invest in prevention and treatment services. I'm grateful to @OsopePatrisse for taking the time to talk with me about @ReformLAJails. I'm proud to support Yes on Measure R, and I'll fight for comprehensive criminal justice reform."
This continues to be one of the hardest questions I've ever had to answer. No child should have to go to school afraid for their lives. We must end the gun violence epidemic now.
These airline catering employees work hard every day to bring food to travelers—they should be paid enough to feed their own families. I stand with them in their fight for fair wages and good benefits.
.@ElenaHung202: I'm fighting to make sure that Xiomara and kids across the country with complex medical needs and disabilities can grow up in a world that is accessible and inclusive—because everyone deserves the opportunity to thrive. I'm proud to fight alongside you.
"We know that a small group of corrupt extremists will do everything they can to stop this bill. That's why I've also got a plan to root out the corruption in Washington. Together, we can end the gun violence epidemic that is devastating our communities."
"The #EndGunViolenceBill is supported by @NAACP, @GiffordsCourage, @AMarch4OurLives, @NewtownAction, @StopHandguns, and gun violence prevention, civil rights, public health, and community organizations across the country."
"Our gun violence epidemic is a public health emergency—and we need to make big, structural changes if we want to end it. So today, I introduced the #EndGunViolenceBill in the Senate to confront this crisis head on."
".@foe_us is a leader in our fight to defeat the climate crisis, and I'm deeply grateful for their endorsement. This is the existential threat of our time—and when I'm president, I'll fight for a #GreenNewDeal and a 100% clean energy future."
Our government officials can best serve the American people when they reflect the diversity of the country itself. That's why I'll build a Cabinet and senior leadership team that reflects the full diversity of America.
"Thank you, @One_Colorado! LGBTQ+ Americans should feel free to be who they are and live without fear or discrimination. I won’t stop fighting for them."
"Navient has avoided paying $22 million it owes to the federal government. Now they're asking Betsy DeVos to wipe that debt away. It's absurd. When I'm president, I'll cancel debt for student loan borrowers—not the loan servicers who cheat and abuse them."
"Right now, we have a government that works great for the wealthy and well-connected—at the expense of everyone else.

I'm fighting to make sure we have a government and an economy that works for working families. And I’m proud to fight alongside @WorkingFamilies and @MauriceWFP."
"People told me the CFPB could never happen—but it did. People told me I could never beat a popular Republican incumbent—now he's a former senator. I know how to fight, and I know how to win. Will you chip in $3 to help fund our grassroots campaign?"
"Trump's cruel ""Remain in Mexico"" policy put asylum seekers' lives in danger. When I'm president, I'll reverse this cruel policy and ensure that asylum seekers are treated with the dignity and respect that every human being deserves. #RestoreAsylumNow"
"I'm fighting to put power in the hands of working people, and as president, I'll fight to strengthen unions and empower their voices. Because when unions win, all workers win."
"Big corporations push to enact state ""right to work"" laws to crush unions and the workers they represent. I’ve led the fight against these laws, and today I’m reintroducing a bill in the Senate to eliminate them nationwide."
"Too many families like Laura's are struggling to get by, coping with one financial crisis after another. All she wants is a fair shot—for herself, and for her kids. I'm fighting to make sure our economy works for every family in America, not just the wealthy and well-connected."
"This is our moment in history to dream big and fight hard for the big, structural change our country needs. If you’re ready to join us, hop on the dialer and talk with Iowans about our movement. This is how we’ll do it—together."
"Gun violence. Climate change. Health care. Criminal justice reform. Immigration.

We know what's broken, and we know how to fix it. But, because of corruption, nothing ever gets done.

If we want to make big, structural changes, we need to root out corruption in Washington."
"Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in history—and if we want to beat him in 2020, we need to draw the sharpest possible distinction with his corruption. I'm running to root out corruption in Washington and make government work for everyone."
"Thank you so much! Together, we’re going to build a country of our best values."
Kids like Autumn are worried about the threat of climate change. I'm fighting to protect her future and the future of our planet—not to protect the profits of corporate polluters putting that future at risk.
"The stakes of this election are too high. We need to fight the spread of false information that disempowers voters and undermines democracy. I’ll do my part—and I’m calling on my fellow candidates and big tech companies to do their part, too."
"Campaigns and tech companies can take a number of steps to slow the spread of misinformation right now. And as president, I'll take a series of actions to further address the spread of disinformation."
"I'm also calling on tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google to take real steps right now to fight disinformation spread on their platforms. The safety of our democracy is more important than shareholder dividends and CEO salaries."
"I’m sending a clear message to anyone associated with the Warren campaign: I will not tolerate the use of false information or false accounts to attack my opponents, promote my campaign, or undermine our elections. And I urge my fellow candidates to do the same."
"So today, I’m making a pledge: I will not knowingly use or spread disinformation to benefit my own candidacy or damage others. And I will fight disinformation aimed at my campaign, my opponents, and voters."
"Anyone who seeks to challenge and defeat Donald Trump must be prepared to take on the full array of disinformation that foreign actors and people in and around his campaign will use to divide Democrats, suppress Democratic votes, and erode the standing of the Democratic nominee."
"In the 2016 election we saw how digital disinformation was used to influence and suppress voters. But 4 years later, we're hardly better prepared for it. Donald Trump has welcomed foreign interference in our elections, and if he isn't removed from office, he'll continue to do so."
"Disinformation and online foreign interference erode our democracy, and Donald Trump has invited both. Anyone who seeks to challenge and defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 election must be fully prepared to take this on—and I've got a plan to do it."
"A small group of the wealthiest families has gobbled up a massive amount of wealth—at the expense of everyone else. 

This is what the wealth gap looks like in America today. It's time for a #WealthTax."
"The world changed after 2016. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have been outperforming men candidates in competitive elections. We took back the House and state legislatures because of women candidates and women who got out to help elect them.

Women win!"
"Donald Trump not only ordered his team to “get rid” of a career ambassador, but did so at a private dinner with wealthy donors. For too long, money has bought access. It’s time to get money out of politics, pursue real campaign finance reform, and end corruption in Washington."

I'll be on @TheLastWord with @Lawrence shortly to talk about the Senate impeachment trial and how we'll root out corruption in Washington.
"No matter where you live in America, you should have the opportunity to thrive. I want Washington to work for communities all over this country—including our rural communities—and I've got a plan to make sure it does. Thanks to everyone who joined us for our Davenport town hall!"
"Gordon Sondland got his job as an ambassador after donating $1 million to Donald Trump’s inaugural committee. Lev Parnas bought access to the president using foreign money. On day one of my presidency, I will take aggressive steps to end Washington corruption."
"I called Mary Ellen to say thank you for making the three millionth contribution to this campaign! This is how we're going to create big, structural change—together. Chip in $3 or whatever you can now to join this movement."
I was proud to take the @ProtectRDfnders pledge—and I've proposed a plan to end sexual assault in the military. We owe it to our service members to make real change and reform the military justice system.
I'll be on @NewsHour shortly to talk about the Senate impeachment trial against Donald Trump—tune in.
"Our health care system is immoral and inefficient, and it is costing lives. No one should be able to make a profit off of denying people health care. I'm fighting for #MedicareForAll for families like Jenny's."
"We can beat Donald Trump—and when the dust settles, I'll fight like hell to make this a country that works for everyone. Watch our new Nevada ad in Spanish."
"We must end this cruelty. I’ll reverse this bigoted, xenophobic ban on my first day in office."

"I'm deeply grateful for @UniteHere11's endorsement. They're on the front lines of the fights for better wages, benefits, and dignity on the job—including when they won their historic contract with Sodexo. I'm proudly fighting by their side."
"Trump's ""peace plan"" is a rubber stamp for annexation and offers no chance for a real Palestinian state. Releasing a plan without negotiating with Palestinians isn't diplomacy, it's a sham. I will oppose unilateral annexation in any form—and reverse any policy that supports it."
I couldn't do this without my family by my side. Check out our new Iowa ad!
"I’m proud to endorse @JosePGarza, an experienced public servant with a proven track record of standing up for working families. With him as Travis County District Attorney, we'll gain another champion in the fight to transform our criminal justice system."

"It's time to invest in keeping Americans safe and healthy. That’s why I have a plan to prevent and prepare for outbreaks, contain them if they do break out, and push for medical advances to treat emerging infectious diseases."
"Donald Trump has deprioritized global health security, repeatedly tried to nickel and dime key federal programs, refused to confront climate change, and done almost nothing in response to natural disasters that could cause serious outbreaks, like the hurricanes in Puerto Rico."
"To effectively beat infectious diseases like coronavirus, we need all hands on deck. But like so much else, Trump’s approach to keeping us safe from disease outbreaks is a mess. When he's gone, we must fix the damage he's done—and I've got a plan for that."
"Are we going to give in to the fear, or are we going to fight back? I'm ready to fight back.

Fighting back is an act of patriotism."
"Try as they might, the White House should know that the evidence against Donald Trump will not be hidden forever. On day one as president, I will order the release of every document related to this impeachment inquiry. The American people deserve to know the truth."

"Even with scholarships, even with a bit of savings, Carolyn still had to take out loans to afford to go to college. She wants her son to have a better future, free from debt. That's why I've got a plan for universal free two- and four-year public college and technical school."
"This is simply another way for the Trump administration to attack immigrants, particularly those with disabilities. Families shouldn't be forced to choose between staying in our country and basic health care and housing. I'll overturn this rule as president."
"I'm so grateful for these endorsements. This is how we're going to make big, structural, progressive change, and build a movement that will defeat Donald Trump."
We can‘t ask our military to solve problems that can’t be solved militarily. It's time to end these endless wars and bring our troops home.

"It’s hard to save enough for a decent retirement, and it’s only getting harder. That's why I've got a plan to increase Social Security benefits by $200 a month—the biggest increase in nearly half a century—so seniors like Michael can retire with dignity and live independently."

From immigration to health care to climate change and beyond, Americans are ready for big, structural change—and I’m in this fight all the way."
"All the president’s lawyers have done today is make the case for documents and witnesses. If Trump didn't do anything wrong when he withheld aid for personal, political reasons—well, release the documents and prove it to us. They won’t, because what Trump did was illegal."
It’s true!
"My daddy couldn't work for awhile after his heart attack. We lost the station wagon and nearly lost the house. But my mom got a minimum wage job that saved our home.

Today, a minimum wage job can't keep a mom and a baby out of poverty.

It's time to raise the minimum wage."

"Trump provoked a conflict with Iran, then concealed and diminished the injuries our troops suffered as a result. It's appalling. I worked in the Senate to improve treatment of traumatic brain injuries—and as president I'll end the wars that cause them."
"Abortion rights are human rights.
Abortion rights are economic rights.
We will never stop fighting to defend those rights."
"Being a working mom was hard, and it was child care that nearly brought me down. Today, it's holding back families like Amber's. Every family should have access to high-quality, affordable child care—and we can pay for it with my #WealthTax."
The UN’s ruling in favor of protecting the Rohingya is an important step forward in accountability and protecting the human rights of Muslim populations around the world. We can’t be silent in the face of the atrocities the Rohingya have faced.
"Republicans and the White House have made it clear that they don't want the American people to know what happened. When I'm president, I'll order the release of every document related to the impeachment inquiry that they've been hiding so the American people know the full truth."
"If we want to end this crisis for good, we need universal free public two- and four-year college and technical school. Everyone should have the opportunity to get an affordable higher education—and I've got the plan for that."
"The student loan debt crisis didn't happen by accident. States invested less in public college students and shifted the burden onto them and their families. So while I paid $50 a semester, today's students are graduating with thousands of dollars of debt."
"States should focus on funding public schools, not private ones—especially not ones that maintain anti-LGBTQ+ policies. We must ensure every kid—especially LGBTQ+ kids—can get a high-quality public education."
"I want every little girl to grow up knowing that when they fight from the heart, they can win—and we pinky promise so they won’t forget."
"Thank you, @DMRegister, for your endorsement! Iowans are ready to make big, structural change—and I’m going to fight my heart out for everyone in Iowa and across the country."
"My promise to Jennifer, to Iowans, and to everyone in this country is this: I’ll fight for you as hard as I fight for my family. 

From immigration to health care to climate change and beyond, Americans are ready for big, structural change—and I’m in this fight all the way."
"All the president’s lawyers have done today is make the case for documents and witnesses. If Trump didn't do anything wrong when he withheld aid for personal, political reasons—well, release the documents and prove it to us. They won’t, because what Trump did was illegal."
It’s true!
"My daddy couldn't work for awhile after his heart attack. We lost the station wagon and nearly lost the house. But my mom got a minimum wage job that saved our home.

Today, a minimum wage job can't keep a mom and a baby out of poverty.

It's time to raise the minimum wage."
"Every day, doctors see firsthand what our broken system does to patients who skip prescriptions, treatments, and tests due to cost. This week, thousands of doctors came out in support of fixing that system for good and I’m grateful to have them in this fight for #MedicareForAll."
"Happy Lunar New Year to all those around the world celebrating! Bruce and I wish you a joyous holiday spent with family and friends, and warmest wishes for health and success in the new year."
"Health care workers do so much to care for their communities. They need and deserve fair wages, benefits, and safe staffing levels. I support the workers of @SEIU1199NW—and my team will be standing with you at all seven strike locations next week."
"Thank you, @BioProfessorMom. I’m proud to fight alongside you to make sure our economy works for all of us."
"Thanks, @JBrostoff! LFG!"
"David is a fifth-generation farmer—and he hopes that his two daughters have the opportunity to carry on farming. But if there's going to be a sixth generation of Rosmann farmers, we need to level the playing field for family farms in Iowa and across the country."
"Trump provoked a conflict with Iran, then concealed and diminished the injuries our troops suffered as a result. It's appalling. I worked in the Senate to improve treatment of traumatic brain injuries—and as president I'll end the wars that cause them."
"Abortion rights are human rights.
Abortion rights are economic rights.
We will never stop fighting to defend those rights."
"Being a working mom was hard, and it was child care that nearly brought me down. Today, it's holding back families like Amber's. Every family should have access to high-quality, affordable child care—and we can pay for it with my #WealthTax."

"Even more disturbing, damning evidence that Donald Trump undermined our diplomatic relationships, our committed public servants, and our national security for his own personal, political gain. This is exactly why we need a real trial, with witnesses and documents."
"My fight for social, racial, and economic justice is rooted in my faith. Faith doesn't just call on us to think good thoughts—it calls on us to act. Today, I'm proud to introduce my Interfaith Advisory Council—principled faith leaders who know our fight is a righteous struggle."
"Yesterday, our grassroots campaign surpassed three million grassroots donations. I’m deeply grateful for your support: This is what your contributions are building."
"Three million double-woohoo thank yous, Team Warren! You make our campaign possible."
"I believe in the rule of law. The United States must be a country where the rule of law means something. If we don't re-establish the rule of law in this country, every future administration will think they can act illegally without facing any consequences."
The White House and the Republicans have made clear that they don't want the American people to know what happened. So they're not letting any of the documents out and they aren’t allowing any witnesses. But they should know this evidence won’t be hidden forever.
"On day one as president, I will order the release of every document related to this impeachment inquiry that the administration has been hiding. The public needs to know what happened. All the other candidates for president should commit to take this step as well."
I'll be on @CBSThisMorning soon to talk about the impeachment trial and how we'll hold Donald Trump accountable.
"Thousands of lives were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, while unused aid remained in a warehouse under the government's watch. That's corruption—plain and simple. I stand with the people of Puerto Rico as they demand accountability from their government."
"Impeachment managers laid out a clear case describing how Donald Trump solicited a bribe from President Zelensky when he pressured him to open investigations into a political opponent. If any other official did that, they would be in jail. This is a criminal presidency."
"Trump has sought foreign interference at least twice to help him in elections. He’s a repeat offender—and if Senate Republicans protect him now, they are giving him a green light to do it again."
"John Stumpf oversaw a scam that hurt hundreds of thousands of customers and cost workers their jobs. It's not accountability for him to give back a fraction of the millions he made. As I've said, he should be criminally investigated—and put in jail if the facts justify it."
Toxic “forever chemicals” like PFAS should not be in our water. My administration will fully enforce safe drinking water standards and aggressively regulate chemicals in our water supply—including by designating PFAS as the hazardous substance that it is.
"I knew that I wanted to be a teacher—and it was my second grade teacher who made me believe that I could. #PublicSchoolMadeMe who I am today, and I'll fight for our public schools, our teachers, and our students."
"The conditions in Parchman are dangerous and inhumane, and we are seeing the deadly consequences. As we fight to end mass incarceration, our government needs to meet basic human rights standards for the people under its care. #MSPrisonReformNow"
"Construction workers building our cities deserve justice and fair wages. As a former @UHouston law professor, I stand with @WorkersDefense members fighting for justice and dignity as they call on @UHPres to ensure workers are paid what they’re owed."
"Thank you, @SDNYC! I’m proud to fight alongside you so every LGBTQ+ American has the opportunity to thrive."
The Bolsonaro government is pursuing state retaliation against Glenn Greenwald because of his work as a journalist to expose public abuse and corruption. Brazil should drop the charges immediately and stop its attacks on a free and open press.
"Mitch McConnell took an oath to uphold the Constitution. No one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. I’m in the Senate, ready to uphold my sworn duty to the American people. Republicans should do the same."

"Donald Trump has done serious damage to our government. As president, I’ll move swiftly to appoint new personnel who will undo his disastrous policies—and I'll adopt the strictest anti-corruption hiring rules of any administration in American history."
"The president of the United States has abused our government for his own personal, political gain. It's corruption, plain and simple.

We have a moment now to root out corruption and make sure government works for everyone—not just Donald Trump and his rich cronies."
I'll be on @Maddow shortly to discuss the impeachment trial and how I'm fighting to root out corruption in Washington.

"Thank you @foe_us for your leadership. I'm proud to take this pledge. We've got to make sure our government and our economy work for our family farmers, farmworkers, and food chain workers—not just Big Ag and giant corporations."
Immigration and law enforcement should be kept separate. Combining them only sows distrust and harms public safety. I stand with @ArribaLasVegas and @MALDEF. Las Vegas must honor its pledge to stop unconstitutionally detaining immigrants.
This bill is a huge step forward. State employees work hard to serve and support Colorado families—they deserve the same in return. I stand with @CoWINSpolitics in the fight for collective bargaining rights. It's time to rewrite the rules to strengthen the voices of workers.
"We need to make sure our government and our economy work for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. There are nearly 140 million poor and low-income people living in this country—almost half of our population. This is the central question of our election."
Black and Brown women are leading the charge to protect reproductive rights—yet they face significant barriers accessing abortion care. My administration will empower their leadership and fight against the decades of systematic racism that has led to this point. #RoeVWade
"If Michael Bloomberg wants to be the Democratic nominee, he should let reporters do their jobs and report on him, and everyone else, as they see fit. And he should divest from Bloomberg News so there’s no question about his influence over news coverage of presidential candidates."
I’ve taken more than a thousand unfiltered questions from the press and from voters since I got in the race. I welcome tough questions and scrutiny because the free press is a cornerstone of our democracy—and every presidential candidate should be closely vetted.
Bloomberg News banned its reporters from investigating Democratic candidates as Mike Bloomberg runs for president. This ban puts reporters in an impossible situation and undermines a free press. Bloomberg should lift the ban and divest from Bloomberg News.
"After Ebola, Congress invested to prevent pandemics like coronavirus. Donald Trump tried to cut that funding. As president, I’ll fully fund global health security, research on medical countermeasures, and public health capacity at home to keep us safe and healthy."
"There are 40 million people locked in poverty in our country. Yet, we've barely been asked any questions on poverty in the seven Democratic debates we've had so far. I agree with @RevDrBarber and @UniteThePoor. We need a #PovertyDebateNow."
"Reproductive rights are human rights.

Reproductive rights are economic rights.

And I will fight to protect those rights."
"Trump's spent his entire presidency attacking every lifeline we have for struggling families. Democrats will win by not just defending these benefits, but by fighting for progressive expansion of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. See my plans:"

"I know how to get our government working for the people because I’ve done it before. In 2010 President Obama picked me to get the CFPB up and running. We recruited a mission-driven staff, set up the organization, and it acted swiftly to protect Americans from financial predators."
"Donald Trump has done serious damage to our government. He's left key positions unfilled. Of those he has filled, he’s appointed lobbyists, campaign donors, and cronies. His current vindictive actions mean he's likely to do everything he can to undermine the next president."
"One year from today, the next president will begin her first full day of work. She’ll inherit a government in crisis, infected by corruption, and will need the expertise and drive to rebuild it and ensure it works for the people. I've got a plan for that."
"Shahab Dehghani is an Iranian student with a valid F1 visa, returning to finish his education. CBP already held him overnight. His deportation must be halted, and we must fight the Trump administration's xenophobic policies."

"For-profit detention companies donated generously to Donald Trump, and they've made millions implementing Trump’s cruel immigration policies. It's corruption, pure and simple. I'll fight to permanently ban for-profit prisons and detention centers."
I'm heartsick for Mustafa Kassem and his family. Imprisoned for six years with negligent medical care—while Donald Trump praised the dictator who held him prisoner and refused to hold him accountable. We must stand up for human rights.
"I plan to engage communities by showing up, listening, and learning. And part of that is making sure to uplift the voices of my team, so that their lived experiences can help shape our plans and our movement for change."

"I'm grateful for every single one of these endorsements, and I'll keep fighting so that every family has the opportunity to thrive."
We’re far behind the curve—and families are suffering for it. We need paid family and medical leave for all workers now.
Republicans and the Trump administration are hoping that the Supreme Court will back their extreme plans to limit access to abortion and birth control—which is why I've got a plan to protect both no matter what the Supreme Court does. Enough is enough.
Amazon made over $10 billion in profits but paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2018. That won’t happen when I'm president. Use this calculator to find out how much big corporations would pay when they pay their fair share.
"The Trump administration wants to weaken the law that bars American companies from bribing foreign officials. That’s corruption, plain and simple. I have a plan to reform our global financial system—and fight corruption at home and abroad."
"It’s hard to be a small business owner, especially when you have to pay much more in taxes than companies like Amazon.

My administration will fight the influence of corporate money to make our government work for the people—not giant corporations."

"I know how to get our government working for the people because I’ve done it before. In 2010 President Obama picked me to get the CFPB up and running. We recruited a mission-driven staff, set up the organization, and it acted swiftly to protect Americans from financial predators."
"Donald Trump has done serious damage to our government. He's left key positions unfilled. Of those he has filled, he’s appointed lobbyists, campaign donors, and cronies. His current vindictive actions mean he's likely to do everything he can to undermine the next president."
"One year from today, the next president will begin her first full day of work. She’ll inherit a government in crisis, infected by corruption, and will need the expertise and drive to rebuild it and ensure it works for the people. I've got a plan for that."
"Shahab Dehghani is an Iranian student with a valid F1 visa, returning to finish his education. CBP already held him overnight. His deportation must be halted, and we must fight the Trump administration's xenophobic policies."
"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. awakened the conscience of a nation and challenged us to live up to our highest ideals. So though this is a moment of crisis, I marched with a heart full of hope that together we'll one day achieve the racial, social, and economic justice he dreamed of."
"Virginians voted for candidates who support gun violence prevention legislation. The majority of Americans—including a majority of gun owners—support reform too. And they will not be silenced or intimidated. #IStandWithVirginia, and I will fight alongside you to end gun violence."
"For-profit detention companies donated generously to Donald Trump, and they've made millions implementing Trump’s cruel immigration policies. It's corruption, pure and simple. I'll fight to permanently ban for-profit prisons and detention centers."
I'm heartsick for Mustafa Kassem and his family. Imprisoned for six years with negligent medical care—while Donald Trump praised the dictator who held him prisoner and refused to hold him accountable. We must stand up for human rights.
"I plan to engage communities by showing up, listening, and learning. And part of that is making sure to uplift the voices of my team, so that their lived experiences can help shape our plans and our movement for change."
"Today we honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and his fight for social, racial, and economic justice. We honor his struggles and triumphs. We honor his courage and his vision."
"So, I guess @AmyKlobuchar and I are now both undefeated in elections and undefeated in New York Times endorsements!"
"I'm grateful for every single one of these endorsements, and I'll keep fighting so that every family has the opportunity to thrive."
We’re far behind the curve—and families are suffering for it. We need paid family and medical leave for all workers now.
Republicans and the Trump administration are hoping that the Supreme Court will back their extreme plans to limit access to abortion and birth control—which is why I've got a plan to protect both no matter what the Supreme Court does. Enough is enough.
Amazon made over $10 billion in profits but paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2018. That won’t happen when I'm president. Use this calculator to find out how much big corporations would pay when they pay their fair share.
"The Trump administration wants to weaken the law that bars American companies from bribing foreign officials. That’s corruption, plain and simple. I have a plan to reform our global financial system—and fight corruption at home and abroad."
"It’s hard to be a small business owner, especially when you have to pay much more in taxes than companies like Amazon.

My administration will fight the influence of corporate money to make our government work for the people—not giant corporations."
"And we do that by investing in Black Americans and creating opportunity. The fights for social, racial, and economic justice belong to all of us—and when I’m president, that truth will inform our policies and our actions."
"For generations, the federal government has prevented African Americans from building wealth and financial security. It's time for our government to acknowledge its actions and step in to make opportunity available for African American communities."
"Black Wall Street was defined by the human spirit. So the community was rebuilt relatively quickly, peaking in the 1940s. But it declined in the sixties and seventies because of gentrification and failure to have a systematic mentorship process in place."
"In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat white nationalist violence and associated acts of terror."
"The men responsible for killing hundreds of innocent African Americans committed an act of domestic terrorism, but they were never held accountable. The search for the victims’ mass graves continues to this day, as does the domestic terrorism threat of white nationalism."
"While we can never undo this hateful act of domestic terrorism or the pain and suffering it inflicted on the Black community, we all must do our part to dismantle the legacy of systemic racism and oppression that was left in its wake—and that starts with justice and opportunity."
I had the chance to visit the site of the Tulsa Race Massacre—a terrible chapter in our nation's history.
"Nearly 100 years ago, mobs of white residents descended on Black Wall Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma, ransacking Black businesses and murdering hundreds of African Americans. The Tulsa Race Massacre was one of the worst incidents of racist violence in our nation's history."
"What gets you in this fight?

I want to hear from you—because I’m fighting for you as hard as I fight for my own family. Chip in $3 or whatever you can right now, and I could call you soon to say thank you. 

We can only do this together."
"2020 is our chance to stand up to Big Money and make our government work for working people. In Newton, Iowa, @Deb4CongressNM and I spoke with voters about how a Warren administration will do just that."
"Let’s be clear: Our government should make health policy based on what’s good for the American people, not what’s good for Donald Trump."
"The Trump administration's cruelty knows no limits. In a Warren administration, we’ll treat immigrants and refugees with dignity and respect."
"Early voting started yesterday in Minnesota, and Jared and Davis camped out in the cold to cast the first votes in the state for me! It’s an honor that makes me feel deeply humbled and grateful. Of course, I had to call them to say thank you!"
"I stand in solidarity with everyone marching across the country today—from Florida to New York to Chicago. Together, we’ll keep fighting for a more equal world."
"Our campaign is run by volunteers like Suzanne. Even if you don’t live in Iowa, we’re counting on you. Join our #WarrenRoadWarriors program to help knock doors with @IAForWarren and in other early states:"
"My plan for disability rights and equality grew from the community, and I'm grateful for the contributions of advocates like @MaysoonZayid. Together, we can build a truly inclusive country!"
"I’m fighting for families like Carolyn’s in Grinnell, and everywhere in Iowa. Student loan debt is a crisis—and it’s why I have a plan to start canceling it for millions of Americans on day one.

What you could you do if you weren’t crushed by student loan debt?"
"White supremacists and people with hateful ideologies of all kinds feel empowered and protected by Donald Trump. This has to stop. In a Warren administration, we’ll use the full force of the Justice Department to fight this head on."
"The Iowa caucuses are on February 3—and I can’t wait.

As the people of Iowa get ready to make their voices heard, follow @IAForWarren to stay up to date on the latest news from our team on the ground in Iowa."
"From the Trump administration to giant corporations like Amazon, it’s clear: The wealthy and well-connected have too much power.

Chip in $3 to my campaign right now, and let’s put power in the hands of the American people."
"And we do that by investing in Black Americans and creating opportunity. The fights for social, racial, and economic justice belong to all of us—and when I’m president, that truth will inform our policies and our actions."

I don't take these endorsements lightly. I’m committed to working together to ensure that we level the playing field for the Latinx community.
"Thank you, Scott! I’m grateful for your support."
"A Warren administration will never suck up to those who want to take power away from working people. I’ve led the effort to end anti-worker right-to-work laws, and as president, I’ll make it easier to join a union."
I’m about to return this survey to the National Right to Work Committee.
"Decades of institutionalized racism have targeted Black and Brown communities and destroyed their families. To face our mass incarceration problem, we need to prioritize rehabilitation and tackle the problem at its roots."
"Our broken capital punishment system has decided the fate of too many people, especially people of color. We must end the death penalty in America for good."
"Not only are Barclays bankers flat-out wrong about my #WealthTax—they’re scared. The wealthy and the well-connected are terrified of losing their power and profits, but it’s time to put power where it belongs: In the hands of working people."
Student loan debt is a crisis—and it's only growing larger. This is crushing an entire generation and holding back our economy. That's why I will act on day one of my presidency to start cancelling student debt and getting relief to families.
"I was born and raised in Oklahoma, on the ragged edge of the middle class. I never imagined I'd be back home as a candidate for president of the United States."
"Our best moments as a country are when we see a challenge clearly and mobilize to meet it head on.

When we imagine a better world and fight for it with everything we have."
"If you've been waiting for your moment to get in this fight—this is it.

We need all hands on deck to knock doors, make phone calls, and talk to your neighbors about their plan to caucus. Text GOTC to 24477 to get started."
Here's my promise to you: I'll fight for your family just as hard as I fight for my own.
"Fear doesn't win. 

Courage, vision, and hope win."
"Florida voted to restore voting rights for 1.4 million of their fellow citizens—and Republicans are doing everything they can to undermine the will of the people. We must fight this voter suppression—in Florida, and nationwide."
"I've got three older brothers—John, David, and Don Reed. Two of them are Republicans, but we are united in our common values: Fighting for our families and our communities."
"This is corruption, plain and simple. And we must root it out."
"These bills would cause immense harm to LGBTQ+ Floridians—especially children. I'll fight to protect LGBTQ+ youth, including by passing the Equality Act, banning conversion therapy nationwide, and ensuring that every LGBTQ+ person gets the gender-affirming health care they need."
"Thank you, @DanielCoronaNV! I’m proud to be in this fight by your side."
"Thank you @JoyceWoodhouse! Together, we’ll build a country where every child has the opportunity to thrive."
"Thank you, @JamiraBurley. Together, I know we can build a country where everyone—not just the wealthy and the well-connected—has the opportunity to thrive."

The warning signs are clear. We must take bold action now—or we will continue to break temperature records year after year.
"If we want to protect access to abortion, birth control, and reproductive health care, we must elect candidates up and down the ballot who will protect our rights. I'm proud to stand with @PPact."
"I’m proud to be in this fight alongside @JulianCastro. Together, we’re going to build the movement for big, structural change."
The Department of Education is sitting on evidence of massive racial disparities in student debt. My administration would start canceling student loans on day one—and open a civil rights investigation into racial disparities in student debt.
"Grateful for every single person’s endorsement. Your leadership during these dark times gives me hope. 

My promise to you is this: I will continue learning and listening to the community, and I’m in this fight with you all the way."
"The president not only undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain—he also broke the law. He must be held accountable or he will continue breaking the law and putting the country at risk."
"The people of Puerto Rico have shown incredible strength and resilience in the face of multiple disasters, and we cannot forget or ignore their suffering. I'll fight to ensure they get the aid and resources they need to recover."
"And as we fight the climate crisis, I will make environmental justice a core part of our fight, ensuring that communities in Puerto Rico on the front lines of this crisis receive the pre-disaster mitigation and post-disaster aid they need and deserve."
"I've got a plan to provide comprehensive debt relief to Puerto Rico, which will help rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure after these devastating natural disasters."
"Donald Trump’s cruel indifference to Puerto Rico's suffering is only a small part of the problem. Puerto Rico is dealing with a debt crisis, fueled in part by Wall Street firms that are using their desperation as just another opportunity to make a profit."
"The Trump administration, meanwhile, has been sitting on billions of dollars of disaster aid that Congress appropriated to provide Puerto Rico with relief."
Puerto Rico was on its way to recovering from multiple devastating hurricanes—and these earthquakes are only compounding the damage to local infrastructure.
"The last few weeks have been terrifying for the people of Puerto Rico. Hundreds of earthquakes have struck the area, some of which have caused devastating damage. Homes have been destroyed—or are so unstable that families are afraid to sleep inside."
"Lev Parnas's interview on @maddow tonight is damning. He's an associate of Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and implicated Trump in a criminal extortion scheme. How can any Senator argue that we don't need a real trial, with witnesses and documents?"
"Despite the challenges we face, I left the #DemDebate stage with a heart full of hope. This is our moment to fight for big, structural change, and we will build it together."
"Workers have been striking against Asarco's abusive labor practices for over four months. Some are taking temporary jobs to make ends meet, while Asarco rakes in profits. I stand with @Teamsters, @steelworkers, and the other unions in their fight for fair wages."

"Thank you @Sally_Field! I'm so grateful to have you in this fight. Together, we're going to build the big, structural change our country desperately needs."
I stand with the people of Puerto Rico. Trump should release the full amount of natural disaster aid that Congress appropriated. Lives are at stake.
"Imagine a country where the decisions made in Washington aren’t simply bought and paid for by lobbyists and big donors.

"As @USNavy looks to expand NAS Fallon, it hasn’t meaningfully consulted and worked with the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe. That’s unacceptable. As president, I’ll seek Tribal Nations’ free, prior, informed consent for decisions affecting their lands."
Student loan debt is widening the racial wealth gap. Enough is enough. #CancelMyDebt
I saw the warning signs of the student loan debt crisis more than a decade ago. Families can't wait any longer for relief. That's why I'll use every tool a president has to start providing relief on day one of my presidency.
"With just days until the Iowa caucuses, any amount you can give helps @IAForWarren keep up the momentum—from purchasing materials for canvasses to last minute ad buys.

I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope because this is our moment in history. Our moment when no one is left on the sidelines—our moment when we build the movement to make real change. #DemDebate

"We have a chance to unite as Democrats, independents, and Republicans. I’m building the grassroots movement leading the fight. We’re going to make America work for everyone—not just the rich and powerful. That’s how we’re going to beat Trump. #DemDebate"
"Two of my brothers are Republicans. There are a lot of things we disagree on, but there's a whole lot we agree on: My brothers are furious over giant corporations making billions of dollars in profits and paying zero in corporate taxes. We must root out corruption. #DemDebate"
"People are suffering. We must get as much help to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible—and I’ve worked out a plan so we can do that without raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate"
We’ve known about the climate crisis for decades. But the fossil fuel industry came in to make big money and stop change. We must take back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate and on all of the issues. #DemDebate
"Climate change threatens every living thing. On day one, I’ll do everything a president can do all by herself to fight this crisis: Roll back the changes that Trump is putting in place, stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands, and end offshore drilling. #DemDebate"
"The impeachment trial will show that this is the most corrupt administration of our lives. That’s what lies at the heart of it—Trump putting Trump first. We need to draw that distinction, and show that Democrats are fighting on the side of the people. #DemDebate"
"Some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution. It says that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. We have an impeachment trial, and I will be there because it is my responsibility. #DemDebate"
"In 2008, people asked if an African American could be elected president of the United States. We said yes, stood behind our candidate—and changed America. #DemDebate"
"We need a #WealthTax in America. We need to ask giant corporations to pay their fair share. That’s how we build an economy that works for everyone, bring down the national debt, and invest in our kids and our future. #DemDebate"
"As a young mom, child care would have sunk me if it weren’t for my Aunt Bee. My plan is #UniversalChildCare, paid for with my #WealthTax so we can cover child care for all of our children and provide universal pre-k for every 3 year-old and 4 year-old. #DemDebate"
"We have to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible. My #MedicareForAll plan does that without raising taxes on middle-class families by one penny. On day one, I will cut the cost of drugs like insulin and EpiPens that Americans rely on. #DemDebate"
"We need to start with what's happening in America: People are suffering. 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription—and couldn't afford to have the prescription filled. Let’s be clear: We need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate"
Keep in mind that the men on this stage have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every race are the women—Amy and me. #DemDebate
The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can’t pull our party together—or someone who takes big parts of the democratic constituency for granted. We need a candidate who will excite all parts of our party and bring everyone in. #DemDebate
"Can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on the #DemDebate stage tonight. Collectively, they have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women: @AmyKlobuchar and me. #DemDebate"
"I led the fight against the trade deals that weren’t in the interest of the American people, American workers, or the environment. We have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting. And they are hurting because of Donald Trump's initiated trade wars. #DemDebate"
"We need a policy that actually helps our workers and our farmers. The USMCA is a modest improvement. I believe we should accept that relief, try to help the people who need help, and then we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal. #DemDebate"
"We need authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the Constitution provides, and that is what I will do as Commander-In-Chief. #DemDebate"
"We have to stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We need to work with our allies, and use our economic and diplomatic tools.

We need to get our combat troops out of the Middle East—now. #DemDebate"
"We have a revolving door in Washington between the defense industry and the Pentagon. That’s corruption⁠—and as president, I’ll block that revolving door and cut our defense budget so the defense industry isn’t calling the shots. #DemDebate"
"The job of the Commander-in-Chief is to keep America safe. That's about judgment. I've sat on the Senate Armed Services committee, I've worked with our generals, I’ve visited our troops. My 3 brothers were in the military—I know how much military families sacrifice. #DemDebate"

"Zachariah pitched in a few bucks to our campaign, so I called him to say thank you!

Tonight’s the #DemDebate and we have a new mid-month goal to hit—$750,000. Chip in $3 right now, and I could call you next:"
"Big banks want you to believe that people who file for bankruptcy are reckless or irresponsible. The truth is that they're struggling, and just one disaster is enough to send them over a cliff. They don't need shaming—they need relief."
Donald Trump is undermining our national security—and he just might be helping his rich buddies get even richer along the way. The American people deserve answers.
"After I dropped out of school, I thought my dream of going to college and becoming a teacher was over. But I found a commuter college where tuition was $50 a semester—and I got to live my dream.

I'm fighting so everyone can have the same opportunities I did."
Canceling student loan debt is a racial justice issue. #CancelMyDebt
Circulating images of Democrats in hijab or a turban as a way of insulting them denigrates the faith of millions of Muslims and Sikhs. Islamophobia and racism have no place in the Oval Office. No American should have to worry about their faith being denigrated for political gain.
Enough is enough. We have to cancel student loan debt—and make public two- and four-year college and technical school tuition free so we never end up in this crisis again.
"If you were no longer tied to your job in order to pay off student loan debt, where would you go? #CancelMyDebt"
"Families can't wait. Big, structural change will start on day one."

"Thank you, @Castro4Congress! You've been a powerful voice holding the Trump administration accountable in the House, and I'm proud to have you on #TeamWarren."
"The future of our economy and a generation of student loan borrowers are at risk, and we must use every tool and opportunity we have to help them. We can't let corruption in Washington hold back big, structural change. I’m committed to seeing this fight through—no matter what."
"I will also use all the tools available to me to address the racial disparities in higher education, crack down on for-profit institutions, and eliminate predatory lending."
"Understand this: The Department of Education has broad authority to end the student loan debt crisis. When I'm president, I plan to use that authority."
"I made sure Congress provided $700 million in a relief fund for borrowers who dedicated their lives to public service but missed technical requirements for loan forgiveness, and I fought to cancel loans for 80,000 students who were cheated by Corinthian Colleges."
"When I was elected to the Senate, I used every opportunity and tool available to ease the burden of student debt. I fought to lower interest rates, refinance loans, and hold loan servicers and debt collectors accountable for breaking the law and hurting borrowers."
"We have a student loan crisis—and we can't afford to wait for Congress to act. I’ve already proposed a student loan debt cancellation plan, and on day one of my presidency, I’ll use existing laws to start providing that debt cancellation immediately."
"Thank you, @YNB! I’m proud to be in this fight alongside you for big, structural change."

"I support the right of the people of Iran to peacefully protest against their corrupt government. But this isn’t about us. We should support them, including by lifting the Muslim Ban—not try to engineer regime change or recklessly risk a war."
"We all do better when everyone has the opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of life. Together, we must fight to build a truly inclusive world."
I’m deeply grateful to have the support of the @AFTMass and @BTU66. They’re on the frontlines of making sure our educators have dignity on the job and that every kid can build a better future. I look forward to standing shoulder to shoulder with them in this fight.
"Thank you, @CoryBooker. You've always been a powerful voice for justice and equality, and you've made this primary stronger. I know you will continue to be a leader in the fight to defeat Donald Trump and build a stronger future for America."
I'm not afraid to stand up to billionaires and giant corporations because I'm in this fight to build a government and an economy that works for everyone. Check out our new ad in New Hampshire!
"Everywhere I go, I hear stories of families like mine—hanging on to their place in the middle class. They're worried about a health crisis, a lost job, losing their house or their car. But they still have hope—and they're ready to fight for the America they know we can be."
"We need a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. In Marshalltown, Iowa, @JulianCastro and I talked about how we can build a country where every single family has the opportunity to thrive."
"We know what's broken in this country, and we know how to fix it. But widely popular policies are stuck. If we want to make big, structural change, we can’t let corruption in Washington hold up the changes we desperately need to make. It’s time to get rid of the filibuster."
"Florida teachers are rallying for fair pay and better funding for schools, and they won't be intimidated or undermined. I stand with the teachers—and I'll fight so that teachers get the fair pay and well-funded schools they need and deserve."
"Housing.

"Let’s be clear: Climate change is putting all of our futures in jeopardy.

I’m grateful for the opportunity to talk with voters about my plans to defeat the climate crisis in Milford, New Hampshire."
"The Iowa caucuses are just 23 days away. If you sign up to make calls to Iowa caucus-goers this weekend, I could give you a call! You can start making calls from anywhere, right now.

"Climate change is the existential crisis we all face. It’s why I’m fighting my heart out for big, structural changes like a #GreenNewDeal and a #BlueNewDeal."
"There are still huge problems with our bankruptcy laws today, in large part due to harmful provisions in the 2005 bankruptcy bill. It’s why I have a plan to overhaul consumer bankruptcy rules in this country and restore the middle class."
"My response was to study contracts, finance, and—most of all—economic failure, to learn everything I could. And I started a ten-year fight against the banking industry’s efforts to change our bankruptcy laws so they could squeeze everything they could out of working families."
"I don’t think my dad ever spoke the word “bankruptcy,” at least not when I was around. He and I were both afraid of falling off the financial cliff. His response was to not talk about money or what might happen if it ran out. He stayed away from sores that hurt. I poked at them."

"Private equity greed is driving up rents and costing thousands of people across the country their homes and jobs.

It's time to rein in Wall Street greed, and I applaud my colleagues in the House for their work to hold them accountable."
"I've got a plan to create 10.6 million green jobs, and @rgunns—one of the architects of the #GreenNewDeal—is here to answer your questions about how we can build a green new economy together!"

"We must renew our fight against housing discrimination, and I’ll start on day one. As president, I'll restore the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule to help end housing segregation."
"It's going to take bold plans and a grassroots movement fighting together to defeat the climate crisis. I'm grateful for @SunriseMvmt's leadership in this fight, and I'm proud to fight alongside them for a #GreenNewDeal that rebuilds our economy powered by 100% clean energy."
"The status quo is working great for the wealthy and the well-connected, but not so much for everyone else.

"The big banks want you to believe that families go broke because they're irresponsible or wasteful. But when I studied why families go broke, I found devastating stories. Lost jobs. A medical crisis. A death in the family. These families don’t need shaming. They need relief."

Cash bail is an unreasonably punitive and financially burdensome system that disproportionately victimizes Black and Brown communities. Rolling back these reforms would blatantly disregard the voices of New Yorkers who voted to end it.

"The fundamental question: Who should our democracy work for—the wealthy and the well-connected, or everyone else? I made the decision to run a grassroots campaign instead of sucking up to billionaires. If you think that's the right way to run, join us:"
The banking industry wants you to believe people who file for bankruptcy are reckless or irresponsible. The truth is that they're struggling with rising costs and flat wages. One crisis is enough to send them over the edge. They don’t need shaming. They need relief.
"Finally, I'll close the loopholes that allow the wealthy and corporate creditors to abuse the bankruptcy system at the expense of everyone else."
"Bankruptcy also doesn’t affect all people equally. Women and people of color are more likely to file for bankruptcy, which is partly a reflection of wealth and income disparities. I'll take additional steps to target specific problems to help eliminate these shameful disparities."
My plan also makes it easier for people to protect their homes and cars in bankruptcy so they can start from a better foundation as they try to rebuild their financial lives.
"We have a student loan debt crisis in America in part because our bankruptcy system makes it nearly impossible to get rid of that debt, even when you have nothing left. While I'm fighting to cancel student loan debt, I'll also fight to make that debt dischargeable in bankruptcy."
Bankruptcy law places certain spending limitations on people while they’re in the process of bankruptcy. My plan pares back some of those burdensome limits—like those that prevent families from paying rent—so families have a chance to recover after the bankruptcy process.
"My plan starts by making it easier for people being crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy by streamlining the process, reducing the costs of filing, and giving people more flexibility in bankruptcy to find solutions that match their financial problems."
"In 2005, the banking industry pushed through a bill to change our bankruptcy laws so they could squeeze everything they could out of families. The bill hit working families hard and resulted in 250,000 more foreclosures during the financial crisis. It's time for an overhaul."
"I spent most of my career studying why American families go broke. What I discovered was that they weren't reckless or irresponsible—they were being squeezed by an economy that forced them to take on more debt, and one bad break sent them tumbling over the edge."
"This economy is pushing struggling families to the breaking point, and our bankruptcy laws make it harder for them to get back on their feet. That's not right. I've got a plan to overhaul our consumer bankruptcy rules."

"I just finished speaking with @Maddow about the urgency of our moment. We can make our economy and government actually work for the people—but only if we fight for it. Chip in $3 before tomorrow, and I could give you a call soon to say thanks!"
I'll be speaking with @Maddow shortly about how to build a country and an economy that works for everyone—tune in on @MSNBC!
"At town halls in Davenport, Iowa, and across the country, people tell me about what's broken—about the things they're afraid of. But in spite of the fear, they have hope that things can change, because they believe in America, and in each other. And I believe, too."

"Right now our government and our economy are working great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not so much for everyone else. Every family should have the opportunity to thrive, and @JulianCastro and I are going to fight for that—together."
"The way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values—here in Manchester, Iowa, and everywhere in America. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win."
"Thank you, @JulianCastro! You’ve been a powerful voice for bold, progressive change and I’m honored to have your support. Together, we'll fight to make sure every single family in America has a path to opportunity."
Now let’s make sure we value their work! I’ve got a plan to boost wages for women of color and open up new pathways to the leadership positions they deserve.
We have to pick up each other's fights. Because that's how we'll build a better America for our kids and grandkids—by fighting together.
"Our achievements weren't born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams. Our best moments have been when we see a challenge and mobilize to meet it head-on. In Hanover, New Hampshire, and all across the country, Americans are ready to fight for a brighter future."
Congratulations to new dads Daniel and Scott—a double woo-hoo thank you for knocking doors with @TeamWarren in Ohio!
I’m so grateful for the hard work of @IAForWarren organizers like @Anna_Navin!
I have the best team. Here’s how they get our selfie lines done so that we can take great photos together!
I look forward to chatting with #CripTheVote this Tuesday!
"Yesterday, Reagan and Elle asked me two important questions in Iowa. Here are my answers:"
"Tell Emery I'm so sorry that they couldn't join us—but they’re an important part of this fight, and I'm proud to fight alongside them!"
"Our selfie line is an opportunity to listen to your stories and hear why you got in this fight. Selfie by selfie, photo by photo, person by person—we’re growing our grassroots movement together."
"Thank you, @LatinoCommFdn!"
Councilwoman @MitraJNelson is right. My heart is in solidarity with the Iranian-American community. We must fight for our democracy now more than ever so that it has space for all our communities.
"You are threatening to commit war crimes. We are not at war with Iran. The American people do not want a war with Iran. This is a democracy. You do not get to start a war with Iran, and your threats put our troops and diplomats at greater risk. Stop."
"Before I hit the photo line, I put on my sneakers."
"It’s official: #WarrenSelfie 100,000 in Manchester, Iowa! I don’t spend my time asking rich donors for big checks—I  spend it with voters. Our selfie line gives me a moment (or 100,000) to meet our movement."
"Racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered and protected by Donald Trump—and we’re seeing the violent consequences.

We have to get Trump out of the White House and fight against white nationalist violence."
"These reports are deeply disturbing. Iranian Americans have the same rights as all other U.S. citizens and should be treated with dignity and respect at our border—not bigoted, xenophobic scrutiny."
"Right now our government and our economy are working great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not so much for everyone else. Every family should have the opportunity to thrive, and @JulianCastro and I are going to fight for that—together."
"The way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values—here in Manchester, Iowa, and everywhere in America. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win."
"Thank you, @JulianCastro! You’ve been a powerful voice for bold, progressive change and I’m honored to have your support. Together, we'll fight to make sure every single family in America has a path to opportunity."
Now let’s make sure we value their work! I’ve got a plan to boost wages for women of color and open up new pathways to the leadership positions they deserve.
We have to pick up each other's fights. Because that's how we'll build a better America for our kids and grandkids—by fighting together.
"Our achievements weren't born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams. Our best moments have been when we see a challenge and mobilize to meet it head-on. In Hanover, New Hampshire, and all across the country, Americans are ready to fight for a brighter future."
Congratulations to new dads Daniel and Scott—a double woo-hoo thank you for knocking doors with @TeamWarren in Ohio!
I’m so grateful for the hard work of @IAForWarren organizers like @Anna_Navin!
I have the best team. Here’s how they get our selfie lines done so that we can take great photos together!
I look forward to chatting with #CripTheVote this Tuesday!
"Yesterday, Reagan and Elle asked me two important questions in Iowa. Here are my answers:"
"Tell Emery I'm so sorry that they couldn't join us—but they’re an important part of this fight, and I'm proud to fight alongside them!"
"Our selfie line is an opportunity to listen to your stories and hear why you got in this fight. Selfie by selfie, photo by photo, person by person—we’re growing our grassroots movement together."
"Thank you, @LatinoCommFdn!"
Councilwoman @MitraJNelson is right. My heart is in solidarity with the Iranian-American community. We must fight for our democracy now more than ever so that it has space for all our communities.
"You are threatening to commit war crimes. We are not at war with Iran. The American people do not want a war with Iran. This is a democracy. You do not get to start a war with Iran, and your threats put our troops and diplomats at greater risk. Stop."
"Before I hit the photo line, I put on my sneakers."
"It’s official: #WarrenSelfie 100,000 in Manchester, Iowa! I don’t spend my time asking rich donors for big checks—I  spend it with voters. Our selfie line gives me a moment (or 100,000) to meet our movement."
"Racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered and protected by Donald Trump—and we’re seeing the violent consequences.

We have to get Trump out of the White House and fight against white nationalist violence."
We need to call out the fact that Americans with disabilities are excluded from economic opportunity and denied financial security. I have a plan to fight and change that.
"About time. I called for a criminal investigation of the Wells Fargo CEO in 2016, and successfully pushed for the bank's board members to be held accountable.

When CEOs and top bankers break the law, they should go to jail—just like anyone else."
"Woo-hoo! Glad to see @TeamWarren Okies hard at work in my home state.

As we get closer to voting, having conversations with voters is one of the most important things we can do. The good news is you can start making calls now, from wherever you are!"
"The problem isn't big government versus small government.

The problem is a government that's been captured by the rich and powerful.

The solution is creating a government that works for everyone—not just the wealthy and well-connected."
"New Hampshire's legislature passed a bill to raise the minimum wage—and Gov. Sununu vetoed it.

We need to raise the federal minimum wage so everyone, in every state, has a living wage that can support themselves and their families."
"If you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness, you're more than halfway there. First you have to see it. Then we fight for it. 

Between selfies and pinkie promises in Concord, I heard those dreams. Together, we'll build that future."
"Just a few hours into the new year, another trans American was killed in a senseless act of gun violence.

Dustin Parker was a father, a husband, and an advocate who looked out for his community. We must fight for justice for him and all trans Americans."
"Nobody fighting for climate action should be afraid that they’re going to lose their job. In a Warren administration, I will fight to protect and strengthen workers’ voices, especially those who are holding their employers accountable."
"Too many ""American"" companies have only one real loyalty: The short-term interests of their shareholders. If they can outsource jobs to save a nickel, that’s exactly what they'll do.

We have to defend good American jobs—and I've got a plan for that."
"The catastrophic scenes from Australia's wildfires should alarm all of us. Climate change is driving even more dangerous and destructive fires across the world, from California to New South Wales—and we must fight together to defeat this crisis."
"The Trump administration is expanding its dangerous and cruel ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, putting the lives of even more asylum seekers at risk. As president, I'll reverse this policy and ensure that asylum seekers are welcomed."
"People with disabilities, like Sarah, are still fighting for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion—and I'll be fighting alongside them. Together, we built a plan to fight for justice and inclusion."
"Donald Trump is dangerous and reckless. He's escalated crises and betrayed our partners. He's undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain.

We cannot allow him to drag us back into another war. We must speak out."
All three of my brothers served in uniform. I know the sacrifices we ask of them and their families. Trump’s actions put every service member and diplomat in the region at risk. This is a moment for vigilance—for Americans to speak up and speak out. No more Middle East wars.
Donald Trump ripped up an Iran nuclear deal that was working. He’s repeatedly escalated tensions. Now he’s assassinated a senior foreign military official. He’s been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office—but the American people won’t stand for it.
"We’re on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East—one that would be devastating in terms of lives lost and resources wasted. We’re not here by accident. We’re here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here."
"I called Laura, a teacher, to say thank you. We agreed: We need a teacher in the White House! 

I'm so grateful for every single person who chips in to our grassroots campaign. This is how we can win—together."
"In 2019, nearly one million donors pitched in to raise more than $71 million for our grassroots movement—with zero closed-door fundraisers. 

I'm so deeply grateful for everyone supporting our campaign. Team Warren is ready to dream big, fight hard, and win!"
"Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war."
"Right now, employers are allowed to pay people with disabilities wages as low as 4¢ per hour. This is shameful. People with disabilities have the same rights to fair wages and economic security as everyone else. I'll fight to end the subminimum wage."
We need to call out the fact that Americans with disabilities are excluded from economic opportunity and denied financial security. I have a plan to fight and change that.

"Republicans want to turn back the clock, outlaw abortion, and deny people reproductive health care—and they're hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play. We need to take back the Senate and pass federal laws protecting our reproductive rights."
"Thank you, @JustStimming, for making sure we had those details right. I’m in this fight alongside you all the way!"
"I’m deeply grateful for all of your work on this plan and for your work on the ground in North Carolina, @SeeMiaRoll. I’m proud to fight alongside you for justice for people with disabilities."
"Issues of racism can't just be issues for Black and Brown women—they must be issues for all of us. I talked with @AshantiGholar on @TheBGGuide about the Black-white wealth gap, student debt, and how my plans will build an economy that works for everyone."
"Sarah sent me a letter asking me to make sure that people with disabilities like her brother aren't left behind. 

Sarah, here's my promise to you both: I will fight so he can get all the care and services he needs to live a self-determined life in a community that loves him."
"I’m proud to fight alongside you—for Xiomara and all our kids. This is how we’re going to win, together!"
"I’m fighting for @MattBC and @CosetTheTable, and all disabled Americans, because no one should be forced to choose between critical benefits and marrying the person they love."
"Thank you for your tireless advocacy and hard work, @ANeeman. I’m grateful to have you on the working group for this plan!"
I'll fight to expand and reform Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income to ensure financial security for all. I'm deeply grateful to @JulianCastro for helping shape this conversation—and look forward to working side by side to enact these changes.
"Thank you, @RebeccaCokley, for taking my call and helping build this plan. I’m proud to work with you!"
"Thank you so much for your thoughtful work on this plan and for being a part of @BlackWomxnFor, @VilissaThompson. Intersectionality is how we get this done! I’m proud to fight alongside you."
"New technology can foster accessibility for people with disabilities—if it's affordable. My hearing aid law will help bring down costs, and my administration will work to bring down the costs of assistive technologies for everyone who needs them."
"Thank you, @MaysoonZayid. Together, we'll fight for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion for all."
"We all do better when everyone has the opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of life. Together, we can realize a truly inclusive world. Because when we organize together, when we fight together, and when we persist together, we can win."
"Finally, we must lead the fight for disability rights worldwide. Under Trump, the U.S. has neglected its responsibility to be a leader in human rights, including disability rights. As president, I'll make disability rights a priority in my foreign policy."
"As we transition to #MedicareForAll, I will roll back harmful work requirements, enrollment caps, and Medicaid premiums allowed by the Trump administration—to ensure that Americans with disabilities can get the care they need."
"Health care is a human right, but too many people with disabilities face barriers to quality care. We need a system that empowers all people to live full lives and that reflects our values. That system is #MedicareForAll."
"As we tackle environmental injustices and climate change, we must put disability rights front and center. That means accessible and green housing and transportation—and inclusive emergency planning, response, and recovery."
"For people with disabilities, finding affordable housing can be even more difficult due to limited accessible options and discrimination. My administration will fight to ensure they have a decent, affordable, and safe place to live, and strengthen anti-discrimination protections."
"From criminal justice to voting, immigration, and protecting parents with disabilities from discrimination, my administration will safeguard the rights and civil liberties of people with disabilities and work to ensure that our society and democracy are truly inclusive."
"Republicans want to turn back the clock, outlaw abortion, and deny people reproductive health care—and they're hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play. We need to take back the Senate and pass federal laws protecting our reproductive rights."

My administration will work to bring down the costs of assistive technologies that allow people with disabilities to lead fuller lives. We'll also enforce existing anti-discrimination laws and propose new regulations that specifically address discrimination in technology.
New technology has brought many positive changes for people with disabilities—but it can be used in ways that discriminate against them or exclude them from an increasingly digital world. I will fight to ensure that technology is used to advance their interests.
"My administration will support children with disabilities, their families, and their educators by providing crucial early interventions and ensuring kids have meaningful access to a high-quality public education. And we'll tackle discriminatory policies and practices head-on."
We must also rewrite the rules of government programs that trap people with disabilities in poverty. No one should be forced to wait months to receive assistance or choose between critical benefits and marrying the person they love. I'll fight to expand and reform these programs.
"As president, I'll fight for economic security for people with disabilities by rewriting the rules of the economy to end labor market discrimination and exploitation, and foster inclusivity. That starts with fighting for a $15 minimum wage—and ending the shameful subminimum wage."
"Disability activists have organized for years to fight injustice. 2020 marks the 30th anniversary of the ADA, and though we've made significant progress, we still have a lot of ground to cover. In my administration, disability rights and equality will be a top priority."
"People with disabilities are still fighting for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion—and they’re not fighting alone. As president, I'll partner with the disability community to combat ableism and fight for justice across all aspects of life."
"Thank you @JulianCastro for being a powerful voice, for proposing bold and progressive plans, and for using your campaign to help people who need it now. You made this race stronger—and you will continue to be a leader in our party and our country for many years to come."
Americans do big things. That’s who we are. And our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head on. So let's begin this new year with big dreams and bold plans!
"What are your aspirations and dreams for 2020? 

If you weren't stretched to make ends meet, who would you be? If you weren't crushed by debt, what would you do? If you lived without worrying if you could afford the health care and prescriptions you need, how could you thrive?"
"Taking the time to see ourselves and our world better than they are today sparks urgency in our hearts and determination in our minds. As we welcome in 2020, let's take a minute to imagine what our country could look like—what our own lives could look like—in a better future."
"As we look ahead to 2020, let's imagine what our country could look like on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the past three years. That future is possible when we believe in ourselves and in each other—and when we have the courage to fight for it. Happy New Year!"
"Juliette chipped in to help meet our end-of-quarter goal, so I called her to say thanks! If you chip in $3—or whatever you can—before tonight's deadline, I might call you later, too. Dream big, fight hard, and have a safe and happy New Year!"
"If I call you on the phone, just call me Elizabeth! I called Keith to say thanks for contributing to this grassroots campaign. And if you chip in $3 (or whatever you can) before tonight's deadline, I could call you next!"
"Thank you, @AshleyJudd. Together, we can root out the corruption in Washington and make our democracy work for everyone."
"Imagine the future America you want to live in. 

That future is possible—and if we dream big and fight hard, we can build it together."
"I called @choo_ek to thank her for donating to our grassroots campaign and for being a part of @TeamWarren. We're going to do this—together.

Chip in $3 or whatever you can before tonight's deadline, and I could call you soon!"
Woo-hoo! @TeamWarren is still sending out a free sticker to anyone who chips in to our campaign—from now until tonight’s FEC deadline. Chip in $1 or more to claim yours now.
"I called Jaylin to say thanks for chipping in to our grassroots campaign and being a part of this fight. Together, we can make big, structural change in 2020. 

Chip in $3—or whatever you can—and I could call you soon!"
There’s still time to enter if you haven’t already!

"Jonathan chipped in $5 to our campaign, so I gave him a call to say thanks! We talked about my plans to root out corruption in Washington and how we can grow our grassroots movement.

Chip in whatever you can and I might call you next!"
"In the face of hatred, injustice, and oppression, Black Americans throughout our history have never stopped imagining and fighting for a better tomorrow. Black history—American history—has shown us the way to the America of our highest ideals. #Warren2020"
"If you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years—then you are more than halfway there. 

The first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it. #Warren2020"
"There are less than 12 hours until our most important FEC deadline, and our fundraising is still behind last quarter’s.

I’m counting on grassroots supporters like you to help close the gap. Will you contribute $3 now to help meet our $20 million goal?"
Our achievements and victories were not born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams. #Warren2020
"Stay strong out there, Isabella. I know that together, we can elect another wave of progressive women up and down the ballot in 2020 and beyond. Let’s do this!"
"Our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head on.

Fighting back is an act of patriotism. #Warren2020"
"Trump’s reckless decisions to walk away from the Iran Deal and now to launch airstrikes in Iraq without Iraqi government consent have brought us closer to war and endangered U.S. troops and diplomats. We should end the forever wars, not start new ones."
"Let us begin tomorrow committed to dream big, fight hard, and win. Happy New Year! #Warren2020"
"I believe that when future generations of Americans look back on this time, they will celebrate us for choosing hope over fear. I believe they will see that we fought to build an America of our best values—an America that works for everyone. #Warren2020"
2020 is our fight: Our chance to rewrite the rules of power in our country. Our chance to come together despite our differences and mobilize a movement for change. #Warren2020
We know that the America we imagine together is possible when Americans believe in ourselves and in each other—and when we have the courage to fight for it. #Warren2020
But we know in our hearts that power in America can rest with the people. We can and we must have an economy and a democracy that finally works for everyone. #Warren2020
"Those with power dump an endless avalanche of excuses, misdirections, and distractions on the American people. It’s all designed to get us to give up and resign ourselves to the way things are—with them in power and everyone else left behind. #Warren2020"
We begin this fight with a hard truth: No one who has power in Washington is going to give it up easily. #Warren2020
If you can imagine all this—if you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years—then you are more than halfway there. The first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it. #Warren2020
"Imagine an America where no matter the color of your skin, who you love, how you worship, where you were born, or what zip code you live in, you are safe and your opportunities look pretty much like everyone else’s. #Warren2020"
"Imagine an America where the lived experience of women is reflected in committee rooms and corner offices, and yes, even at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. #Warren2020"
"Imagine an America where more women—women of color, LGBTQ+ women, women with diverse backgrounds—have more power to make the right decisions for our country. #Warren2020"
Imagine what’s possible when poor communities and communities of color are no longer dumping grounds for toxic wastes and polluting industries. #Warren2020

"There are less than 12 hours until our most important FEC deadline, and our fundraising is still behind last quarter’s.

I’m counting on grassroots supporters like you to help close the gap. Will you contribute $3 now to help meet our $20 million goal?"
Our achievements and victories were not born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams. #Warren2020
"Stay strong out there, Isabella. I know that together, we can elect another wave of progressive women up and down the ballot in 2020 and beyond. Let’s do this!"
"Our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head on.

Fighting back is an act of patriotism. #Warren2020"
"Trump’s reckless decisions to walk away from the Iran Deal and now to launch airstrikes in Iraq without Iraqi government consent have brought us closer to war and endangered U.S. troops and diplomats. We should end the forever wars, not start new ones."
"Let us begin tomorrow committed to dream big, fight hard, and win. Happy New Year! #Warren2020"
"I believe that when future generations of Americans look back on this time, they will celebrate us for choosing hope over fear. I believe they will see that we fought to build an America of our best values—an America that works for everyone. #Warren2020"
2020 is our fight: Our chance to rewrite the rules of power in our country. Our chance to come together despite our differences and mobilize a movement for change. #Warren2020
We know that the America we imagine together is possible when Americans believe in ourselves and in each other—and when we have the courage to fight for it. #Warren2020
But we know in our hearts that power in America can rest with the people. We can and we must have an economy and a democracy that finally works for everyone. #Warren2020
"Those with power dump an endless avalanche of excuses, misdirections, and distractions on the American people. It’s all designed to get us to give up and resign ourselves to the way things are—with them in power and everyone else left behind. #Warren2020"
We begin this fight with a hard truth: No one who has power in Washington is going to give it up easily. #Warren2020
If you can imagine all this—if you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years—then you are more than halfway there. The first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it. #Warren2020
"Imagine an America where no matter the color of your skin, who you love, how you worship, where you were born, or what zip code you live in, you are safe and your opportunities look pretty much like everyone else’s. #Warren2020"
"Imagine an America where the lived experience of women is reflected in committee rooms and corner offices, and yes, even at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. #Warren2020"
"Imagine an America where more women—women of color, LGBTQ+ women, women with diverse backgrounds—have more power to make the right decisions for our country. #Warren2020"

"Here's my advice to young women on running for office: Fight from the heart. That's how you'll be strong, and that’s how you’ll persuade others to join you."
Working families in Des Moines and across the country deserve a fighting chance. That’s why I have a lot of plans—from increasing Social Security benefits to canceling student loan debt—that will help rebuild our middle class and put power in the hands of the people.
I’m sorry I missed you—but thank you for being in this fight!
"It's also time to ensure our government works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I'll end lobbying as we know it—and I'll shut the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington."
My Real Corporate Profits Tax ensures that very large and profitable companies pay taxes on their reported profits—no loopholes or exemptions. And I'll make it harder for companies to hide their profits in offshore tax havens.
Too many corporations are cashing in on all the benefits of America while skipping out on the bill. Companies that make massive profits shouldn't be paying less in federal income taxes than working families. It's time for them to pay their fair share—and I've got plans for that.

"My heart is with Rep. John Lewis and his family. He’s always been a fighter, and I know he'll continue making good trouble. Stay strong, John."
"The richest Americans with the biggest fortunes keep getting richer, and the wealth gap just gets wider and wider. We need a #WealthTax to level the playing field and fund opportunity—to ensure every family has a chance to succeed."

In 2020, we need to elect a president who will fight this crisis. I'll fight to root out the corruption in Washington, pass a #GreenNewDeal, and create millions of green jobs."

"Families should be able to get an education without being drowned in debt. They should be able to go to work without child care costs eating up their paychecks. They should be able to get the health care they need without risking bankruptcy.

We need big, structural change."
"Keep your phone nearby!

This weekend, I’ll be calling grassroots donors to thank them for chipping in to our campaign. Will you pitch in $3 tonight? I hope we’ll talk soon."
"We're closing out the decade with a widening wealth gap and millions of families drowning in debt due to the costs of health care and higher education. 

In 2020, let's fight for big, structural change to build an economy that works for everyone."
"If you make it big—and I mean really big, top one‑tenth of one percent big—pitch in a few cents so everyone else gets a chance to make it, too. 

It’s really that simple."
Someone had a bit too much Christmas dinner!
"Like I said at the debate, my #WealthTax will boost our economy. And top economists agree with me."
"The best way to grow the economy isn't by giving more money to billionaires and corporations already sitting on piles of money, but by helping working families struggling with the costs of health care, child care, housing, and education."
Bruce and I are wishing a very happy Kwanzaa to everyone celebrating this week!
"One year ago today, Felipe Gómez Alonzo died in CBP custody. He was just eight years old.

This Christmas, I'm heartsick for all of the families who won't be celebrating together today because of the Trump administration's cruel treatment of immigrants and asylum-seekers."

"I stand with Amazon's workers, who are doing back-breaking work this holiday season. Everyone deserves time to spend with their families. And I know that when workers fight together, they can win."
"I never thought I’d be back in my high school gym, running for president of the United States. But you know, you don’t get what you don’t fight for."
"These are difficult times, and yet my heart is filled with hope. It’s because of the people I meet at town halls in Cedar Rapids and all across the country: They're struggling, they've got challenges, but they still believe in a better America—and they're willing to fight for it."
"Our government is working great for the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of everyone else. I’m fighting for big, structural change to make sure it works for families in North Liberty, Iowa, and working families across the country."
"Our big FEC deadline is approaching—and tonight, my team will send me a list of new donors so I can check if we’re on track. 

If you haven’t donated to our campaign before, will you chip in $3? We’re in this fight together."
"Dennis Muilenburg pressured regulators and put profits ahead of the safety of passengers, pilots, and flight attendants. His firing is welcome news—and long overdue."
"We had our Oklahoma City town hall at my former high school—where my high school debate trophy is still on display! Public school made me, and that debate team gave me so many incredible opportunities. I believe in our public schools, and that's why I'm fighting for them."
I never thought I'd be back in my high school—this time as a candidate for president of the United States. But you don't get what you don't fight for!
"By the time I graduated high school, my folks couldn't even afford a college application—much less four years of college. High school debate gave me amazing opportunities, and it was great to meet Oklahoma’s state champions!"
"Oklahoma, it was good to be home!"

Real freedom is a government ban on non-compete clauses so workers can choose the job that’s best for them."
Our country's top turkey companies are getting sued for allegedly conspiring to raise prices. Each of the four major meat industries are now under investigation for price-fixing and collusion. Enough. It’s time to enforce our antitrust laws against Big Ag.
It's great to be back in Oklahoma! Tune in now for a live look at our Oklahoma City town hall.
We need to use every tool we have to combat voter suppression. I'll fight to defend our right to vote and build the grassroots movement to win in 2020.

How do we change the perception of a president as a man with a tie? By electing a woman president.

Donald Trump has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected. We need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democratic nominee who will root out corruption. #DemDebate
Everyone in the Senate has taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution. That doesn't mean loyalty to an individual. It doesn't mean loyalty to a political party. It means loyalty to our country. #DemDebate
"Will you pitch in a few bucks to our campaign before the #DemDebate tonight?

From my #WealthTax to my plan to increase Social Security benefits, I know that big, structural change is possible in 2020 if we fight for it together."
"I had a wonderful time with Francisco and Jose—the winners of our @TeamWarren contest—today in Los Angeles before the #DemDebate! Thanks for being a part of this fight for big, structural change."
"Thank you, @Adaripp. I'm proud and grateful to have you on @TeamWarren!"
Educators deserve fair pay and good benefits that allow them to take care of themselves and their families. I stand with @iftaft and the Decatur teaching assistants—they deserve a #FairContract now.
Congratulations to the airport workers who won their #FightFor15! I'll keep fighting until we raise the minimum wage for all workers across the country.
"The Grassley-Alexander plan would be a gut punch to working families and retirees, and I strongly oppose it."
"We should be fighting to keep teachers in classrooms—not cutting positions and increasing class sizes. I'm standing with the students, parents, and teachers protesting today—I'll always fight for our public schools and teachers."
"John Dingell was a statesman who earned his honors through decades of service, and his memory should be treated with dignity and respect. Bruce and I send our love to @DebDingell, who is carrying on his legacy with incredible grace—for Michigan, and for our country."
"Is America a democracy that is going to be run by the billionaires and giant corporations, or are we going to be a democracy built on a grassroots movement? When it’s money versus the power of a grassroots movement, I'm betting on the people."
"I am proud to have @RGunns, one of the architects of the #GreenNewDeal, in this fight. Together, we can root out the corruption in Washington that's holding up progress and fight to defeat the climate crisis."
"This is deeply concerning. If Comcast wins in their case before the Supreme Court, a key civil rights protection could be rolled back—making it nearly impossible for those facing racial discrimination to be able to hold companies accountable."
How do I answer economists who say a #WealthTax would stifle growth and investment? I say they’re just wrong. #DemDebate
"We must be an America that understands the difference between our allies and dictators who would do us harm. And we must treat our allies better than we treat dictators. Together, we can build a world that’s environmentally and economically sustainable for everyone. #DemDebate"
It’s time to close Guantanamo Bay. It not only costs us money—it’s an international embarrassment. We have to be an America that lives our values every single day. #DemDebate
"We have a government that works great for the wealthy and the well-connected—and for no one else. That is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is. #DemDebate"
"Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. But if we don’t attack corruption head-on in Washington, we won’t be able to make progress in fighting our climate crisis. #DemDebate"
"With a #WealthTax on fortunes of $50 million and above, what can we do?

✅Universal Child Care
✅Early childhood education
✅Cancel student loan debt 
✅And a whole lot more 

That’s how we build an economy that works for everyone. #DemDebate"

"A small group of the wealthiest families has gobbled up a massive amount of wealth, while the middle class has been hollowed out. 

Here's how the wealth gap was built—and how my #WealthTax will level the playing field for all families."
"It’s crucial that our campaign keeps growing. So we set a milestone goal for our movement: 1 million grassroots donors. If a few more people on Twitter help today, we can reach our goal. Can I count on you? Chip in any amount and you’ll get a free sticker."
Black moms are facing a maternal mortality epidemic. One major reason? Racism. It's time to hold health systems accountable.
"Donald Trump has abused our diplomatic relationships and undermined our national security for his own personal, political gain. By voting to impeach him, the House has taken an important step to hold him accountable. I'm ready to fulfill my constitutional duty in the Senate."
"Happy birthday, @AdyBarkan! Bruce and I send our love to you and your family today."
"The Trump administration has abandoned its duty to defend the ACA in court and is cheering on efforts to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions, coverage for kids up to age 26, Medicaid expansion and more. My administration will expand health care, not destroy it."
"The world doesn’t look like it did in 2016. 2020 gives us an extraordinary opportunity to make real, structural change."
"Migrants are our neighbors, our colleagues, and our friends. They make our communities stronger and more diverse. On this #InternationalMigrantsDay and every day, I'll keep fighting to make sure they are welcomed and celebrated here."
"Shame on the UNC Board of Governors—and the Republican legislators who used a power grab to appoint this radical board. Public funds should be used for students, not paying off Confederate groups."
"It’s time for politicians to be honest with the American people about what it will take to defeat the climate crisis, because when Americans decide to go all in on solving a problem, there is nothing we can’t achieve together. #GreenNewDeal"
".@JCisnerosTX is ready to fight for the people of Texas, and I'm proud to stand beside her—let's help her win!"
"I love it! Happy birthday, Shayna!"
"Pinkie promises, group hugs, and flying hugs—some of my favorite moments in the selfie line!"
"I think the @CuriousWithJVN podcast episode that @jvn and I recorded together is something really special. I hope you all like it, too!"
Congratulations to New Jersey for taking this important step to improve safety and protect immigrant families!
"I'm grateful to have the support of these Obama campaign alumni and my fellow Obama administration alumni. Their work changed what we know is possible in our politics. Together, we can win in 2020 and build a government that works for everyone."
I can’t wait to meet you!
"Congratulations to my Campaign Co-Chairs @KatiePorterOC and @Deb4CongressNM for joining @AyannaPressley on the House Oversight Committee! I know Katie, Deb, and Ayanna will fight their hearts out for the rights of working families and consumers."
It's not enough to just beat Donald Trump—we have to root out the corruption that bends our economy and government to work for the wealthy and the well-connected at the expense of everyone else. And I've got plans for that.

"When workers fight together, workers win! I joined @UniteHere11 to celebrate their successful fight for the pay, benefits, and job security their members deserve. I look forward to Thursday's #DemDebate!"
Donald Trump has spent the last three years retreating further into his own bubble and firing anybody who crosses him. I’m not afraid to call him out.
"I've seen firsthand how our middle class was hollowed out while our government and economy were rigged to work for the wealthy and well-connected. I'm fighting for big, structural change so that families in Fairfield, Iowa, and across the country have the opportunity to succeed."
".@Boeing's crisis isn't just about a technical failure—it's about how our government is bending over backwards for giant corporations at the expense of everyone else. It's corruption, plain and simple."
"Our government is working great for the wealthy and well-connected—but not so much for everyone else. I'm fighting to get our government working for working people, so families like the ones I met in Ottumwa have a fair shot at the American dream."
"Around the world, protestors are rising up against corruption and economic inequality. The United States must stand with them and lead the way to fight financial corruption here at home and around the world."
"Financial corruption is a worldwide problem, and my administration will work with our international allies and partners to fight it. We'll expand the technical assistance we offer to our partners. And we'll work together to hold corrupt kleptocrats accountable."
We must overturn Citizens United with a constitutional amendment to end the corruption of our campaigns and elections—but there are also steps we can take now. I'll fight to update campaign finance laws to limit foreign interference and bring dark money into the light.
I’ll work with Congress to enact anti-money laundering reforms and update basic financial integrity requirements. I’ll expand real estate disclosure requirements. I'll strengthen enforcement against financial institutions and clamp down on dark money enablers here in the U.S.
We need a president who will fight back against global financial corruption—and that starts here at home. The United States is at the center of the global financial system and helps to shape international financial rules. We have the leverage to strengthen global transparency.
"Rather than fighting for transparency, Donald Trump has spent his career embracing shady deals and exploiting legal loopholes. He’s repeatedly partnered with shady actors on real estate deals that reek of money laundering, corruption, and fraud."
"Financial corruption is a threat to our security and our democracy. Illicit networks foster corruption, inequality, and kleptocracy. Dark money bankrolls nuclear proliferation, terrorism, human trafficking, and repressive and hostile regimes."
"In some states, creating a shell company to hide your identity is easier than getting a library card. The global flow of dark money is a serious threat—and it's time to root it out. I've got a plan to fight global financial corruption at home and abroad."
"This is good news. But we have a lot of work still to do to fight back against measures that criminalize homelessness and ensure every American has a safe, decent, and affordable place to live."
"I guess calling up billionaires to ask for giant checks is one way to spend time.

But I’d rather spend my time with people who aren’t scared of big, structural change. Will you chip in $3 to our campaign now? I might call soon to say thanks."
"I spend my time with grassroots donors like Mike, because I think grassroots donors should be deciding the Democratic nominee."
"You probably paid more federal income taxes in 2018 than companies like Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton, and IBM. That’s corruption—and I’ve got a plan to make giant corporations start paying their fair share."
"When billionaires and giant corporations wanted a tax cut, it took Republicans a few weeks to get it done. Our government isn't gridlocked—it's working great for the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of everyone else."
"Politicians should be competing over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can keep from voting. We need to fight back against these attempts to undermine our elections and pass reforms that strengthen our democracy."

Mental health care is a human right. I continue to stand with @NUHW clinicians who are going on strike across California. @KPThrive must ensure patients get the mental health care they need—and mental health care workers deserve the same benefits as other Kaiser workers.
The Trump administration wants to allow federal grantees to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized groups—we need to make our voices heard. Submit a comment to show HHS and Trump that you oppose this rule.
"Families like Belinda’s are struggling. Costs keep going up, and even with three jobs, Belinda can barely support her family. That’s not right. We need a #WealthTax to level the playing field so that families like hers have the opportunity to succeed."
"The Trump administration must extend the deadline to enroll for health care coverage. Any delay or attempt to keep Americans from enrolling is completely unacceptable.

If you are trying to enroll and   is down, call (800) 318-2596."

We don’t have time for inaction. The countries of the world must come together to defeat the climate crisis. A Warren administration will fight for climate justice at home and abroad.
"Paychecks are barely budging, but the costs of housing, child care, health care, and education just keep going up. Families in Clinton, Iowa, are working hard—and it's time to make sure they all have opportunities to thrive."

Gig workers deserve fair pay and job protections. I'll fight alongside them to end worker misclassification and protect their rights to unionize.

"Seven years ago, 20 students and 6 staff were killed at #SandyHook Elementary School. I’m heartsick for the students and staff we lost that day, and the loved ones who mourn them. We must keep standing up to the NRA and demanding real change to end the gun violence epidemic."
"It was great meeting you and your wife, Damon! I’m deeply grateful to have you in this fight. Let’s keep persisting—together!"
"Real freedom isn’t living under the thumb of giant corporations. 

Real freedom isn’t living in debt, one crisis away from disaster. 

Real freedom isn't watching opportunities snatched up by the rich and powerful.

Real freedom comes when everyone has the opportunity to prosper."
"Young people today are as hardworking as any generation, but opportunity is collapsing around them.

We need big, structural change, so every generation has the opportunity to succeed."

One of Trump's appointees who absolved McDonald's of liability for labor law violations worked at a law firm that McDonald’s hired to counter organizing efforts. This is how our government works great for giant corporations at everyone else's expense.
"Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can keep from the polls. My plan to protect and strengthen our democracy will end this racist voter suppression. Enough is enough."
The details of this memo are horrifying. I'll end the unnecessary detainment of immigrants and enforce strict standards for medical care for anyone in our care. The Trump administration must be held accountable for their negligence and cruelty.
The people voted to restore voting rights to 1.4 million of their fellow citizens who had been disenfranchised in Florida. We must keep fighting efforts to silence their voices. Thank you @NikkiFried for standing up to this injustice and fighting for Floridians! #LetUsVoteFL
.@UniteHere11 is fighting for better wages and benefits—and I stand with them. The DNC should find a solution that lives up to our party's commitment to fight for working people. I will not cross the union's picket line even if it means missing the debate.
"Thank you, @mPinoe! I'm so grateful to have you on @TeamWarren. I promise to fight shoulder-to-shoulder alongside you for equal pay and the bold, structural change our country needs."
Our problem isn’t big government—our problem is a government that’s been captured by the rich and the powerful. I'm running for president to take on a corrupt system and get our economy working for everyone.

I’m deeply grateful for any amount you’re able to give."
I'm proud to be fighting shoulder to shoulder alongside @RepSchakowsky for working families in Chicago and all across the United States!
I’m proud to have @Equity_Center’s top rating. I promise to keep fighting for racial and economic justice—and to close the racial wealth gap.
This is an absurd and ridiculous retaliation by ICE. I stand with @MigrantFreedom. Their hotline to provide legal aid to detained immigrants should never have been shut down.
Immigration and law enforcement should be kept separate so that victims and witnesses of crimes feel safe coming forward—combining them only sows distrust and harms public safety. I stand with @voces_milwaukee in their protest today. Immigrants shouldn't fear their local police.
Our government helped create the racial wealth gap—and government should help fix it. This is a moral obligation.
"Some people dismiss any investment in middle-class families as “free stuff.” 

You know who's getting free stuff? Amazon, which had $10 billion in profits this year and is paying $0 in federal income taxes.

Working families are paying their fair share—let’s invest in them."
"Young people today are as hard-working as any generation, but opportunity is collapsing around them. And if they dare question the corrupt system that has put them in this giant hole, the elites responsible for this mess have the gall to call them lazy and entitled.

Enough."
"I don't sell access to my time. I don't do closed-door fundraisers. And I don't ask for a $1,000 contribution for a selfie. If you want to know about a candidate’s commitment to reform, don’t just look at what they say they will do—look at what they’re doing right now."
Wall Street executives and billionaires are spending their time and money attacking me—they believe I'm the biggest threat to a corrupt system that has enriched them at everyone else’s expense. They are right. I do have a plan to make real change.
I'm so grateful to have @mPinoe on @TeamWarren! LFG.
I’m proud to fight shoulder-to-shoulder alongside @Krasner4DA and @WorkingFamilies for criminal justice reform and an economy that works for everyone!
One of Trump's appointees who absolved McDonald's of liability for labor law violations worked at a law firm that McDonald’s hired to counter organizing efforts. This is how our government works great for giant corporations at everyone else's expense.
"Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can keep from the polls. My plan to protect and strengthen our democracy will end this racist voter suppression. Enough is enough."
The details of this memo are horrifying. I'll end the unnecessary detainment of immigrants and enforce strict standards for medical care for anyone in our care. The Trump administration must be held accountable for their negligence and cruelty.
The people voted to restore voting rights to 1.4 million of their fellow citizens who had been disenfranchised in Florida. We must keep fighting efforts to silence their voices. Thank you @NikkiFried for standing up to this injustice and fighting for Floridians! #LetUsVoteFL
.@UniteHere11 is fighting for better wages and benefits—and I stand with them. The DNC should find a solution that lives up to our party's commitment to fight for working people. I will not cross the union's picket line even if it means missing the debate.
"Thank you, @mPinoe! I'm so grateful to have you on @TeamWarren. I promise to fight shoulder-to-shoulder alongside you for equal pay and the bold, structural change our country needs."
Our problem isn’t big government—our problem is a government that’s been captured by the rich and the powerful. I'm running for president to take on a corrupt system and get our economy working for everyone.
"The opioid epidemic is a humanitarian crisis, and we need bold plans to fight it. I've got a plan to ensure that everyone gets the treatment they need—and to fight the greed and corruption that has driven this epidemic."
"We’re weeks away from the first caucuses and primaries. If a few more people on Twitter chip in tonight, we’ll be on track to grow our grassroots movement before voting begins.

I’m deeply grateful for any amount you’re able to give."
I'm proud to be fighting shoulder to shoulder alongside @RepSchakowsky for working families in Chicago and all across the United States!
I’m proud to have @Equity_Center’s top rating. I promise to keep fighting for racial and economic justice—and to close the racial wealth gap.
This is an absurd and ridiculous retaliation by ICE. I stand with @MigrantFreedom. Their hotline to provide legal aid to detained immigrants should never have been shut down.
Immigration and law enforcement should be kept separate so that victims and witnesses of crimes feel safe coming forward—combining them only sows distrust and harms public safety. I stand with @voces_milwaukee in their protest today. Immigrants shouldn't fear their local police.
Our government helped create the racial wealth gap—and government should help fix it. This is a moral obligation.
"Some people dismiss any investment in middle-class families as “free stuff.” 

You know who's getting free stuff? Amazon, which had $10 billion in profits this year and is paying $0 in federal income taxes.

Working families are paying their fair share—let’s invest in them."
"Young people today are as hard-working as any generation, but opportunity is collapsing around them. And if they dare question the corrupt system that has put them in this giant hole, the elites responsible for this mess have the gall to call them lazy and entitled.

Enough."
"I don't sell access to my time. I don't do closed-door fundraisers. And I don't ask for a $1,000 contribution for a selfie. If you want to know about a candidate’s commitment to reform, don’t just look at what they say they will do—look at what they’re doing right now."
Wall Street executives and billionaires are spending their time and money attacking me—they believe I'm the biggest threat to a corrupt system that has enriched them at everyone else’s expense. They are right. I do have a plan to make real change.
"The thin slice of folks at the top who benefit from our rigged economy push policies that help themselves and push the costs off on everyone else. And they tag any attempt to reform this system as ""divisive"" and ""extreme""—no matter how many Americans agree with it."
"Gloria needs a job with good pay, benefits, and protections for herself and for her son. But Washington isn't on her side—it's on the side of giant corporations. I'm fighting for big, structural change so our government and our economy works for working people like Gloria."
"When unions win, all workers win. I'm proudly fighting alongside @Culinary226 to protect unions and empower the voices of their members!"
"I decided from the beginning that I was going to run a grassroots campaign. I wasn't going to sell access to my time or make promises to billionaires. Our democracy shouldn't be for sale—and if you agree, I hope you'll join us:"
Cutting Planned Parenthood out of public health programs cuts off patients from the reproductive health care they need. I'll fight to protect @PPact and the health services they provide.
"Rising sea levels are already displacing communities.

Offshore drilling is putting the health and economies of coastal communities at risk.

And communities are facing longer, harsher droughts. 

We need a #BlueNewDeal to protect our oceans and fight the climate crisis."
I’m grateful for Dr. @AyanaEliza’s work to make the #BlueNewDeal a reality. Hope you get a chance to send in your questions for her!
"What a well-deserved honor for @GretaThunberg. Climate change is an existential threat, and Greta has been one of the leading voices in this fight. Now it's on us to hear her warning and fight to defeat the climate crisis."
I'm heartsick for the victims and their loved ones. We have to fight the rise of anti-Semitic bigotry and violence—and we have to end the gun violence epidemic that makes these attacks so deadly.
"Thank you, @IndivisibleTeam! I'm committed to fighting for big, structural change, building the grassroots movement that we'll need to get it done, and protecting our democracy."
"Thank you, @cullen_art and @SLTimes. I promise to fight for the big, structural change we need so that everyone has the opportunity to succeed—in rural Iowa, and across the country."
Offshore drilling is putting the health and economies of coastal communities at risk. It's time to transition to 100% clean energy. I'll end all new fossil fuel leases offshore and on public lands—and phase out all existing offshore drilling.
"Some candidates jet off to Manhattan or San Francisco for fancy fundraisers that cost more than $2,000 a ticket.

Not me. We’re building our campaign one small-dollar donation at a time—because the presidency shouldn’t be bought. Chip in $3 now to join us."
"America's middle class has been deliberately hollowed out by the rich and powerful—people who rigged the system to work in their favor, while hanging the rest of us out to dry. It's time for a #WealthTax to ensure that everyone has a chance to succeed."
Héctor Figueroa was a beloved leader for @32BJSEIU and all working people. It’s only fitting that his legacy live on through the Héctor Figueroa School.
Climate change is an existential threat—and our coastal communities are particularly at risk as sea levels rise and storms get stronger and more destructive. The ocean must be a part of the climate solution. That's why I've got a plan for a #BlueNewDeal.
".@CPDAction and their network do transformative work around housing affordability, fighting climate change, and advocating for economic justice. I'll keep fighting alongside you for the big, structural change our country needs."
"I'm heartsick for the family and friends of the victims in Jersey City.

Gun violence is terrifying our communities. We shouldn't have to live like this."
Children are dying in CBP custody due to the flu. Refusing to administer flu vaccines is neglectful and cruel. I'll end the unnecessary detention of children and families—and enforce strict standards for medical care for anyone in our care.
Facebook is allowing entities to target misleading and false ads about HIV prevention drugs to LGBTQ+ communities and others. This can have serious public health consequences. Facebook needs to put the safety of its users above its own advertising profits.

"Uh huh. I'll put any promise Donald Trump makes about student loans right next to his broken promises about protecting people with pre-existing conditions, making no cuts to Medicaid, cutting middle class taxes, protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans..."
New Hampshire state workers deserve fair pay—and an independent fact-finder agreed. I stand with @SEIU1984. It's time for Governor Chris Sununu to stop shortchanging workers and give them the fair compensation they deserve.
Freedom of the press is one of the most important values in our country. A reporter’s coverage of candidates for the highest office shouldn’t be determined by one of the candidates controlling their paychecks.
We have to defeat climate change now—or kids like Eleanor will be living with the consequences for the rest of their lives. We'll start by rooting out the corruption in Washington that's giving Big Oil a free pass to poison our communities.
"Running for president shouldn't be a passion project for bored billionaires. Our democracy should not be for sale. I'll make sure we keep talking about the issues that matter to all families, and I'll keep building a grassroots movement to fight for big, structural change."
"Others have said it before me: ""If you don't have a seat at the table, you're probably on the menu."" I’m looking forward to continuing to fight alongside @SenGillibrand and @KamalaHarris, who are advancing an agenda that will transform the lives of people of all genders."
.@KamalaHarris is a leading advocate for reproductive rights—and I'll fight alongside her to enact her proposal requiring federal preclearance when state and local governments with a history of violating Roe v. Wade try to restrict reproductive rights.
.@SenGillibrand is a leading advocate for national paid leave—and I’ll fight alongside her to enact her plan to make paid family and medical leave available to all workers.
"We've seen a record number of women in this primary. That has meant that together, we've been able to shape the national conversation to highlight issues impacting people in America. But as billionaires buy their way into the race, some of my colleagues have been pushed out."
"It's not just about having a job—it's about having a good job with fair pay, benefits, and that treats its workers with dignity. I've got plans to raise the minimum wage, empower unions, and help workers control their schedules so they can build a future."
We need a #GreenNewDeal. We need to build a new green economy with millions of good jobs. And we need to root out the corruption in Washington that’s holding up every effort to fight the climate crisis. I stand with everyone on #ClimateStrike today.
"Children are dying because of the Trump administration's cruelty, racism, and neglect. The Trump administration must be held accountable—and we must fight to build a humane immigration system."
Pearl Harbor. Pensacola. Not even our military bases are safe from gun violence. I'm heartsick for the victims and their families. We must end this epidemic and protect the lives of our service members.
"Dream Big.
Fight Hard.
And together, we can win!"
"From corruption, to the Electoral College, to Baby Yoda, I'm ready for any question @JimmyFallon throws my way!"
Trump isn't ending needless forever wars—he's only expanding them while keeping Americans in the dark. It's time to responsibly bring our troops home.
Big companies rake in giant profits while squeezing working families to the breaking point. My Fair Workweek plan will help shift power back to America's 27 million part-time workers so they can support themselves and their families.
Grateful down to my toes! We’re going to do this—together.
"Aw! So sorry to have missed your sister, but glad I could bring a little joy."
"Today, I’m making calls to thank grassroots donors. 

Pitch in to our campaign now—and I might give you a call soon to say thanks!"
Donald Trump will keep committing crimes and undermining our diplomatic relationships and national security unless we hold him accountable. I was the first candidate to call for impeachment—it's long past time to hold Donald Trump accountable.
"Yesterday on @FallonTonight, I talked about how we’re running this campaign by people pitching in $20 here and $5 there. No fancy fundraisers, PACs, or giant corporations.

Chip in any amount, and I could call you today to say thanks!"
The devastating impacts of climate change in Puerto Rico have been made worse by decades of neglect and racism. Justice must be at the center of our response to the climate crisis and that's why I will invest $1 trillion in vulnerable communities.
"Giant corporations have too much power—and they’re pushing working families to the breaking point. It's time to make big, structural change to build an economy that works for everyone."
"I talked with @JimmyFallon about how I'm building my campaign from the grassroots up. I want to spend my time with voters, not sucking up to billionaires. If you believe that's what candidates should do, donate tonight—you may get a call from me tomorrow!"
Donald Trump embarrasses America. And he does it repeatedly.
Looking forward to joining @JimmyFallon on @FallonTonight—tune in!
I was glad to meet @Alanis at @FallonTonight! It wasn’t ironic at all.
I have some thoughts on the whole @BillieEilish thing—tune in!
I'll be talking with @Lawrence on @TheLastWord soon about how we can build an economy that works for everyone—I hope you'll join us!
"Congratulations to @RachelForAmes—the youngest woman ever elected in Iowa and the first @IowaStateU student to be elected to the Ames City Council! When women fight, women win. Go Rachel!"
"Universal put money into this race, but if it’s a fight between money and the power of a grassroots movement, I'm betting on the people—and last night, the people won. Congratulations! I'll keep fighting with you for affordable housing for everyone."
This is cruel and disgraceful. Donald Trump will happily give millions of dollars in tax breaks to his billionaire buddies—but he's making it harder for struggling families to be able to eat. I'll reverse this shameful policy.
"I just spoke on @BloombergTV about why billionaires like @MikeBloomberg, who owns their news network, shouldn't be able to buy their way into the White House, and how I've got plans to make our government work for everyone—not just the wealthy and well-connected."
"I'll be on @BloombergTV soon to talk about the big, structural change I'm fighting for. Tune in!"
"Sybrina Fulton lost her son and endured unimaginable pain. Yet she's turning that loss and pain into a drive to serve her community and do good by running for Miami-Dade County Commissioner.

I guess some billionaires figured it'd be a lot cheaper to spend a few hundred million to buy the American presidency than paying their fair share in a #WealthTax so that everyone can succeed. I put an ad on Bloomberg TV to let them know—I'm not backing down from this fight.
"Climate change is an existential threat, and we must get to net-zero carbon emissions as soon as possible if we want to defeat it. That's why I support the #GreenNewDeal—and why I've got a plan to achieve 100% clean energy for America."
"Betsy DeVos really didn't like being held in contempt of court, so she wants to make federal student loans someone else's problem. 

Of course, there's a simpler idea: Universal free college and technical school, and canceling student loan debt."
"Congrats on the move, Larry Page! Quick reminder: We do still expect you to testify before Congress. And changing your title while staying on the board and retaining effective control of it will not exempt you from accountability."
"Donald Trump is pushing out talented diplomats, hollowing out the State Department, and appointing his own donor buddies to be our ambassadors. Our next president will have to rebuild the State Department—and I've got a plan for that."
Fine by me. I’m fighting to give every person in America the opportunity to build a good life for themselves and their loved ones—not to protect giant banks and their billionaire customers.

We're all deeply grateful for @KamalaHarris's leadership on issues from protecting our democracy and advocating for our teachers to ending the Black maternal mortality crisis—and I know my friend will continue fighting for justice.
"Donald Trump abused our diplomatic relationships and undermined our national security for his personal, political gain.

The past few years have shown that unless we hold him accountable now, he will do this again."

"It's not just about having a job—it's about having a good job. Workers are struggling with unpredictable schedules and jobs that won't give them enough hours to qualify for benefits, support their families, or build a future. 

I've got a plan for that."
"Thank you @KamalaHarris for your commitment to fighting for the people, for justice, and to holding Donald Trump accountable.

Kamala is right—our system is deeply broken when billionaires can buy their way in. I'll fight with you to make sure our government works for all of us."
"I stand with @hgsuuaw. Grad student workers deserve fair pay, benefits, and labor protections—and it's time for @Harvard to negotiate with them in good faith."
"We can free students from crushing debt, boost the economy, and reduce both the Black-white and Latinx-white wealth gaps by canceling student loan debt and by providing universal technical, two-year, and four-year public college. And we can pay for it all with my #WealthTax."
Giant companies are raking in profits while squeezing working families to the breaking point. It's time to put more power in the hands of workers. My plan ensures that the 27 million part-time workers in America are treated with respect and can build a future for their families.
"And it's time to remove the perverse incentives that keep giant corporations from making their workers full-time. I'll extend leave and benefit protections to part-time workers, and require employers to offer additional hours to existing part-time workers before hiring new ones."
My plan will give workers who work at companies with more than 15 employees the rest they desperately need by guaranteeing workers 11 hours between shifts and compensating them with higher pay for hours voluntarily worked within that window.
"Under my Fair Workweek Plan, employers with 15 or more employees will be required to give two weeks’ advance notice of work schedules. And employees will be empowered to ask for schedules that work for them, without fear of retaliation."
"These unpredictable schedules make it nearly impossible to work another job, go back to school, or schedule child care. And workers of color—especially women of color—bear the brunt of these abusive scheduling practices."
Millions of workers face unpredictable schedules that can change dramatically day-to-day—even by the hour—with almost no advance warning. A third of workers involuntarily work part-time because they aren't assigned enough hours by giant corporations trying to keep costs down.

"It's a point I've made since my very first campaign: Nobody in this country got rich on their own. They relied on infrastructure we all paid for, employees we all paid to educate. So if you're successful, good for you—now pay it forward so everyone has a chance at success."
"When a private equity firm acquired a doctors group, patients experienced more aggressive medical debt collection lawsuits. Wall Street shouldn't be profiting off of the poorest patients. We need to rein in Wall Street—and we need #MedicareForAll."
"I got a high-quality public education for just $50 a semester—but that opportunity doesn't exist today. States invested less in our public colleges and shifted the burden onto students. 

I'm fighting for universal public college so every student has the opportunity to succeed."
"Climate change is an existential threat, and it's going to take a grassroots movement ready to fight for big, structural change to defeat it. I'm standing with the young activists on #ClimateStrike today—stay strong in this fight!"
America must uphold its commitments and promises to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples—and give them a fighting chance to build stronger communities and a brighter future. I've got a plan for that. #NativeAmericanHeritageMonth
"It worked. Eventually, everyone got back to eating and talking—and Aunt Max was never in charge of bringing the turkey again.

So no matter what cooking disasters, miscommunications, or accidents happen this Thanksgiving, smile, readjust, and try not to take it too seriously!"
"An uproar followed as everyone loudly explained that “bring the turkey” meant a cooked turkey. Aunt Max considered that, then laughed. She said we'd eat Thanksgiving dinner in layers—a Jell-O course, a potato course, a pie course—finishing with a turkey course, in about 6 hours."
"They burst through the front door, and Uncle Crowbar banged the heavy roaster on the kitchen countertop as people crowded around to see the turkey. With a flourish, Aunt Max lifted the lid, proclaiming, “Biggest Turkey Ever!”

Everyone jumped back. It was RAW."
My mother fretted and Aunt Alice fumed. The boys buzzed around trying to get a spoonful of this or a crust of that. Aunt Bee tried to keep everything in order. Still no Aunt Max. Then one of the boys spotted her coming up the walk with Uncle Crowbar (that name is another story).
"Thanksgiving dinner was set for noon, and most of the family was there by mid-morning. The table was set. The sweet potato casseroles were out of the oven. The pies were on display. The Jell-O molds were out on special plates. Food was piled everywhere. But—no Aunt Max."
"Aunt Max was funny and quick-talking. She never took anything too seriously, including time. And she wasn’t much of a cook, so the other sisters made sure that she was up to the task—peppering her with questions, making sure she'd get a big enough turkey."
"Thanksgiving was always a big gathering in our family. The holiday brought in family from Texas, Arkansas, and Kansas. That meant LOTS of planning over who would bring what, how much, and so on.

One year, Aunt Max, my mother’s oldest sister, volunteered to bring the turkey."
"I'm heartsick for Jesus Martinez Manon and his family. We must end this cruelty. No family should live in fear of having their loved ones torn away from them—on Thanksgiving or any day. When I'm president, we'll build a humane immigration system and treat immigrants with dignity."
"This year, I'm grateful for my family, for the incredible opportunities I've had, for the many wonderful people I’ve met, and for the grassroots movement that is fighting alongside me. From my family to yours: Happy Thanksgiving!"
"We're so grateful for everyone who does necessary work over the holidays to keep us safe and healthy. But too many giant corporations shamefully choose profits over people by staying open on Thanksgiving. Retail workers deserve to spend time with their loved ones, too."
"I told @IAForWarren that if it’s a fight between money and the power of a grassroots movement, I'm betting on the people."
This is appalling. Our government has a basic responsibility to protect its citizens from dangerous workplaces—not bend over backwards to absolve and protect giant corporations. Phillip Lee Terry and his family deserve justice.
Thank you @BlackWomxnFor and @MsPeoples for joining me in Atlanta last week. I'll fight shoulder to shoulder with you to put power and resources in the hands of the people.

"At its best, America is a place for big dreams and second chances. That’s what I’ve always fought for, and that’s the America I want us to build together."
"The Trump administration's cruel and dangerous policies are putting children in danger and driving families apart. When I'm president, I'll end his racist policies and welcome immigrants and asylum seekers."
"Presidential candidates typically do ""call time""—also known as calling wealthy donors and asking for big checks.

Not me. Our campaign is funded by grassroots donors like you. Will you pitch in now?"
"Google recently hired a notorious union-busting firm—and yesterday, fired four employees who were organizing their colleagues and holding Google accountable. I stand with Rebecca Rivers and her colleagues. I’ll always fight to protect workers’ rights."
"Monopolies are bad for consumers and our economy—and they're bad for employees, too.

But when workers build a grassroots movement and fight together to hold Big Tech companies like Amazon accountable, they can win."
"Dream big, fight hard, put on your sweatshirt, and let’s get to work!"

"Some billionaires figured it might be cheaper to run for president than pay my #WealthTax. Well they don’t have the power of a grassroots movement—and in our democracy, I believe in the power of people over money."
Fighting for the #GreenNewDeal isn't just about fighting climate change. It's a commitment to building a better future for the working people of our country by creating millions of good union jobs. We can’t fight climate change with a low-wage economy.
We need to build a new farm economy that is truly open to all. I’ve listened to Black farmers and updated my plan to reflect their experiences. We must root out structural racism to ensure Black farmers succeed.
"We need bold action now to pass the #GreenNewDeal, build a green new economy, and defeat the climate crisis—and I've got a plan for that. I'm proud to work alongside groups like @SunriseMvmt to build the grassroots movement we need to fight climate change."
"After my daddy's heart attack, he couldn't work for a while. So my mother got a minimum wage job—and that job saved our house. She was scared, but she found the strength to do what needed to be done to save our family."
"I’ve got a lot of plans to bring big, structural change to Washington. But first, there's one plan that makes it all possible: Making sure we hit our monthly fundraising goals.

Can I count on you to pitch in to our grassroots movement before midnight?"
Private companies shouldn't be able to profit off of incarcerated people by charging them to read a book or video call their family. My plan for criminal justice reform will rein in this exploitation.
I've proposed the biggest and most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly half a century—an immediate $200 monthly increase. Families need financial security.
Nominating top donors to be ambassadors undermines U.S. diplomacy and national security—and I’ve got a plan to end this practice.
"Michael Bloomberg may think he doesn't need people to win this election—he just needs bags of money.

He’s wrong. That's why I'm investing in meeting thousands of voters, taking over 85,000 selfies, and building a grassroots movement that will fight for big, structural change."
Experts agree: Broad student debt cancellation would supercharge economic growth by freeing a generation crushed by debt. Candidates who oppose it should explain why punishing young people matters more than promoting home ownership and business creation.
We need public financing of our elections. But manipulating the rules to attack @WorkingFamilies and push them off the ballot is wrong.
The same communities that have borne the brunt of industrial pollution are also on the front lines of the climate crisis—and extreme weather events could put them at even greater risk. We have to end the climate crisis and clean up Superfund sites.

"But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough."
"The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power."
"Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear."
"Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind."
"Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair."
"And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too."
"When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed."
"So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?"
"To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you."
Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system.
"Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power."
"The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy."
"In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War."
"But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it."
"Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!"
"And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”"
"Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted."
The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
"In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000."
"And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!"
"But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough."

"One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society."
"By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day."
Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
"I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise."
"I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day."
I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.
"I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we've fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarren"
We're live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren
"Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan."
See you soon!
"Climate change is an existential threat—and unless we take urgent action to end this crisis, future generations will face catastrophic consequences. That's why I'm fighting for the #GreenNewDeal."
Big Tech companies are not doing enough to protect our privacy—and they won't until they face real competition and accountability.
Reproductive rights are economic rights. Reproductive rights are human rights. And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.
"Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!"
"Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad."
"The way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll."
Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same.
"Awood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable."
"I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that."
This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.

"To everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

I’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together."
The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption.

"From the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people."
"Our alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan."
"I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called ""right-to-work"" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their ""right-to-work"" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families."
"We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants."
"Ultimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again."
"Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress."
"I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses."
"My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll."
"First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage."
#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days.
"Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies."
"Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together."
"Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities."
"I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights."
"Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable."
"Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence."
"Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes."
"We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security."
"We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president."

"Harvoni is described as a ""miracle"" drug, but it's $94,500-per-treatment price tag leaves 85% of the more than 3 million Americans living with Hepatitis C unable to use it, while taxpayers foot a $3.8 billion bill."
"Truvada’s manufacturer, Gilead, relied on $50 million in federal grants to develop it, but today they rake in multi-billion dollar profits while Americans struggle to afford it. Only a fraction of patients benefit from it, thanks to its hefty $2,000-a-month price tag."
"Humira is used by millions of patients around the world to treat diseases like arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn’s disease. But its manufacturer, AbbVie, doubled its price—and used blatantly anti-competitive behavior to prevent a competitor from entering the market."
"Health officials agree that naloxone is critical to curbing the opioid epidemic, and it can be as cheap as 5¢ a dose. But one company spiked the price of their product by over 550% to “capitalize on the opportunity” of the opioid crisis."
"EpiPens deliver life-saving doses of epinephrine, a drug that reverses severe allergic reactions to things like peanuts and bee stings. In 2016, EpiPens’ manufacturer jacked up prices by 400%, leaving families unable to afford this life-saving medication."
"Insulin was discovered nearly 100 years ago as a treatment for diabetes. But three drug companies dominated the market and jacked up prices. Now, Americans with diabetes are rationing their insulin—and taxpayers are spending billions on it through Medicare and Medicaid."
Prescription drug companies' obscene price gouging is leaving patients without access to lifesaving medical treatments. I've got a plan to lower costs on several key drugs that millions rely on. Here are just a few examples.
"Donald Trump is hollowing out our State Department and undermining our ambassadors—putting our diplomacy efforts in grave danger. We'll need to rebuild our State Department, and I have a plan for that."
I'm going to fight my heart out for #MedicareForAll—and here's how I'll get us there in my first term.
"37 million Americans didn't fill a prescription last year because of costs. Within my first 100 days as president, I will act to lower the cost of essential medications like insulin, EpiPens, and naloxone."
"Millions of Americans will experience the full benefits of a #MedicareForAll option and see how it compares to high-priced coverage and fighting their insurance company tooth and nail. And when we move to complete the transition to #MedicareForAll, the choice will be clear."
And I'll give every American over the age of 50 the choice to enter into a substantially improved Medicare program.
"This option will include all of the health care benefits of #MedicareForAll, including primary and preventive services, pediatric care, emergency services and transportation, vision, dental, audio, long-term care, mental health and substance use, and physical therapy."
"In my first 100 days, I'll fight to create a true #MedicareForAll option that will be immediately free for millions of  Americans, including children under the age of 18 and families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level."
"Thank you, @PramilaJayapal. You've been doing incredible work in the House and have kept the momentum moving forward. I’m honored to keep working alongside you for #MedicareForAll!"
"No one should have to ration their medication or skip filling it because of the cost. As president, I will act immediately to lower the cost of prescription drugs—and I'll fight my heart out for #MedicareForAll."

"In my first 100 days, I'll fight to create a true #MedicareForAll option that will be immediately free for millions of  Americans, including children under the age of 18 and families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level."
"Thank you, @PramilaJayapal. You've been doing incredible work in the House and have kept the momentum moving forward. I’m honored to keep working alongside you for #MedicareForAll!"
"No one should have to ration their medication or skip filling it because of the cost. As president, I will act immediately to lower the cost of prescription drugs—and I'll fight my heart out for #MedicareForAll."
I hope I'll see you at Clark Atlanta University on November 21!
"This is how Wall Street's corrupt grip on Washington will end. Not with a bang, but with the tears of some sad billionaires—who will still be unimaginably rich, but will have paid their fair share so America could cancel student loan debt, have universal child care, and more."
"Billionaires like Blankfein can say whatever they want, but I've spent my career holding big banks accountable and fighting for working families—and I'm going to keep building a movement to make America work for working families."
"One of the billionaires who's so upset with me is Lloyd Blankfein. He ran Goldman Sachs while it misled its own clients in order to turn a profit, which helped create the 2008 crash. His bank then took billions in backdoor taxpayer bailouts, and no one was held accountable."
"On Thursday, my campaign started airing an ad about my #WealthTax. Now, some of the scared billionaires who oppose it are going on TV and tweeting their complaints. It clearly struck a nerve. But we need this tax to help working families—so we’re increasing our ad buy."
I've spent a lifetime studying why families go broke—and the number one reason is health care costs. That's why I'll fight my heart out for #MedicareForAll. Here's how we get there.
"I’ll fight my heart out at each step of this process, for one simple reason: No one should ever die or go bankrupt because of health care costs. And when I’m president of the United States, I’ll do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another person again."
Any candidate who believes modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention. So why not dream big and fight hard for the plan that will cover everyone and provide the best care at the lowest cost?
"The health care industry spent $4.7 billion over the past decade on lobbying. Let's not kid ourselves—every Democratic plan for expanding health care, big or small, is going to be drowned in money to make sure nothing ever happens."
"At each step of my plan, millions more Americans will pay lower costs for care and see the quality of their coverage improve. And millions more Americans will be able to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality #MedicareForAll plan."
"By the end of my third year, I’ll fight to pass legislation to complete the transition to #MedicareForAll. Once millions have experienced the full benefits of a #MedicareforAll option and compared it to the corrupt and wasteful system we have today, the people will demand it."
"We will continue to move forward on health care throughout my term, including by investing $100B in breakthrough medical research and by creating a new drug development institute at the NIH."
I’ll also let anyone over the age of 50 join the existing Medicare program—and I'll improve its benefits and reduce its costs for everyone.
"This #MedicareForAll option will be open to everyone and includes all the health care benefits of #MedicareForAll. It will be immediately free for nearly half of all Americans, including all children under 18 and anyone with income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level."
"Next, in my first 100 days, I’ll use the same process Mitch McConnell used to try and kill the ACA to bypass the filibuster and create a true #MedicareForAll option—more generous than one proposed by any other campaign—to begin the transition to #MedicareForAll."
"First, I’ll act immediately as president to lower the costs of critical drugs—including specific drugs that millions of Americans currently rely on, like insulin and EpiPens. And I'll crack down on corruption to rein in health insurers and drug companies."
"As president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and will protect people with pre-existing conditions. And in my first 100 days, I’ll take executive and legislative action to reduce health care costs and improve coverage."
"Today, I'm sharing my plan to transition to #MedicareForAll. In my first term, we will reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower drug prices, lower the Medicare age to 50 and create a true Medicare for All option—and fully transition to #MedicareForAll."
"Algorithms are only as good as the data that gets packed into them, which means discriminatory biases just keep getting perpetuated. It's not on the women who've been discriminated against to fix the problem—it's on Goldman Sachs."
"Congratulations Ady, Rachael, and big brother Carl on welcoming baby Willow into your beautiful and courageous family! Bruce and I are sending you all of our love."
"Alexis Crawford was an incredible woman with a bright future ahead of her. Black women and girls, especially black trans women, face disproportionately higher rates of violence and homicide, often with impunity. This must stop."
"Gun violence is a public health crisis, and we need to start treating it like one."
Congratulations @rgay and @debbiemillman—sending you both my love!

"I’m fighting Big Money by funding my campaign differently. Other candidates might attend fancy fundraisers and take checks from PACs, but I’m only accepting grassroots donations. 

Will you chip in now? Together, we can change the way campaigns are funded."
"Red tide devastated Florida for sixteen months and now it’s back—killing fish and causing beaches to “smell like death.”

I am fighting for a #GreenNewDeal so that our beaches stay safe."
"From sponsoring fancy dinners to spending millions of dollars on lobbying, the wealthy and well-connected are able to make Washington work for them at the expense of everyone else. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. I've got a plan for that."
"Facebook is spending millions lobbying the government as they face antitrust scrutiny. They're going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. Now, they're sponsoring a dinner headlined by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Let's call this what it is: Corruption."
"Thank you for your courage and your dedication, @BJoeWolf. Together, we can root out corruption in Washington, end gun violence, and ensure that everyone can live safe and free."
"I welcome the Gaza ceasefire. Dozens were killed in Gaza, and hundreds of rockets fired at Israel. We must work to end rocket attacks on Israel, eliminate the Gaza blockade, and solve the humanitarian crisis so that all Israelis and Palestinians live in security and freedom."
"I'm heartsick for the victims of this horrifying shooting and their families. We shouldn't have to live like this. Students shouldn't live in fear when they go to school.

We must act now to end gun violence."
"Maybe if I were sticking $3 trillion under a mattress. But I'm not. I'm using it for:

✅ Universal Child Care
✅ Canceling student loan debt for 95% of those who have it
✅ Investing in public K-12 schools

Which will grow the economy and provide economic security for families!"
"These proposed changes to Puerto Rico's Civil Code are appalling, and would dramatically roll back LGBTQ+ rights. I stand with Puerto Rico's LGBTQ+ activists fighting for their right to live and love freely."
"I knew Mark Zandi was skeptical, so I had him check the numbers on my plan to pay for #MedicareForAll. He confirmed they add up."
"Other campaigns run on fancy, closed-door fundraisers, but you won’t see me doing that. 

Our campaign isn’t powered by the wealthy and well-connected—it’s powered by donors like you:"
"I got my degree thanks to a quality public college where tuition was just $50 a semester. That kind of opportunity doesn't exist for students today. I'm fighting for universal free public two year, four year, and technical college so that every student can live their dream."
"Separating parents and children and detaining families is cruel, unnecessary, and traumatizing. My administration will end unnecessary detention and welcome asylum seekers."
Some billionaires don’t like my #TwoCentWealthTax? I’m shocked.
"Registered apprenticeships give workers the opportunity to get good-paying union jobs, and ensure we have the best workers building our infrastructure. The Trump administration misused funds meant for this program, but we'll fight to protect these apprenticeships."
"We are officially on the ballot in New Hampshire! Let's keep up the momentum for big, structural change—follow @NHforWarren to learn about our upcoming events and how you can volunteer."
The Sandy Hook community organized against the gun lobby and won a major victory in their fight to hold them accountable. Now let's keep fighting to end gun violence.
The student loan debt crisis is disproportionately burdening Black students. I have a plan to cancel student loan debt and help close the racial wealth gap.
"We need to strengthen the Code of Conduct for all federal judges, and extend it to Supreme Court Justices. I've got a plan for that."
"Let's be clear: This is a callous attempt to create more barriers for immigrants and asylum seekers. I'll overturn Trump's discriminatory policies, expand legal immigration, and welcome more asylum seekers."

The American people deserve to know the truth. And it's time to show Trump that no one is above the law—not even the president of the United States.
"The Mueller report made it clear that Donald Trump repeatedly obstructed justice. Many reports have shown he is abusing diplomatic relationships for his own political gain. Now, it's time for the public to see the evidence the House has gathered in these public hearings."
"2020 is our moment in history. It’s our time to dream big, fight hard, and win. But we can only do it together!

If you chip in to our campaign now—$15, $5, heck, even $1—I’ll be grateful down to my toes."
I stand with the Little Rock teachers making their voices heard for collective bargaining rights. We should be strengthening the voices of teachers in our public schools.
"I’m grateful down to my toes for your support. I don’t take it lightly— and I’ll continue to fight alongside you to make big, structural change."
"Redlining often pushed people of color into neighborhoods that were vulnerable to climate change or faced more pollution risks. When we fight for environmental justice, we're also fighting for economic justice."
"If we want to make big, structural change, we need great candidates running up and down the ballot. And we need to show the next generation that they can run—and win. On #NationalRunforOfficeDay, learn more about how you can run for office!"
"Bruce and I are sending our best wishes to our Sikh friends celebrating the 550th anniversary of the birth of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and his teachings of gender equality, racial equality, and religious tolerance for all."

"Thank you to all of the brave protesters who showed up and raised their voices outside of the Supreme Court this morning. #HomeIsHere, and we'll keep fighting for DACA recipients all the way."
"A thinner and thinner slice of the top has taken a massive amount of wealth while America’s middle class has been hollowed out. We need a #TwoCentWealthTax—and we need big, structural change so that our economy and our government works for everyone."
"After Sandra Pezqueda was fired for reporting sexual harassment at @TerraneaResort, workers pushed for a measure to guarantee basic safety. Terranea spent $1 million to defeat it. I stand with Sandra and the workers—this fight isn't over."
"My plan prevents companies like Exxon from using industry-funded fake research to mislead federal regulators and strike down regulations in court. And if they knowingly lie, we'll treat them the same way the law treats anyone who lies in court—by prosecuting them for perjury."
"Industry players and their allies also knowingly submit false and misleading information to regulatory agencies, giving right-wing judges the chance to later use their junk science as an excuse to invalidate regulations."
"Exxon’s scientists knew that climate change was real decades ago. They could've shared their science with the public. Instead, they and the fossil fuel industry launched a decades-long campaign to cover up the facts and deceive government regulators and the American people."
"It’s illegal to lie to Congress, to a court, and even to your shareholders. It should also be illegal for Exxon and other giant corporations to lie to federal regulators. I've got a plan for that."
"I called Chad, a WWII veteran who cast his first vote while serving abroad for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He's committed to fighting for big, structural change again."

"We must honor the promises we've made to service members, veterans, and military families."
"Si eres beneficiario de DACA y se vence en menos de un año, toma acción hoy para renovar tu DACA. Puedes encontrar ayuda en   y   para residentes de CA. Si estás cerca de Washington D.C., únete mañana frente a la Corte Suprema."

"If you're a DACA recipient and your DACA is expiring in less than a year, take action today. Help is available at  , and for CA residents at  . And if you're near DC, join the rally outside the Supreme Court tomorrow."
"Our country made a promise to over 700,000 people that they could go to school, go to work, and take care of their families—safe from deportation. Donald Trump broke that promise. But we're raising our voices and fighting back."
"On #VeteransDay, we honor our veterans and thank them for their service. But we have to back our platitudes with meaningful action and policies that support our military both during and after service—not just today, but every day."
"All three of my brothers served in the military, so I know the responsibility we have to our veterans, and the unique burdens that military families carry. On #VeteransDay, I'm thinking of all our veterans and their families. I'm grateful for your service."
"I’ve spent my career studying why so many hard-working middle-class families are going broke. The number one reason? Health care costs. Even with insurance, families are being crushed by deductibles, copays, and surprise bills. We need #MedicareForAll."
"Let’s be clear: When private equity firms acquire companies, suck out all the value they can, and walk away rich—leaving workers, their families, and their communities suffering with the consequences—it’s legalized looting. I have a plan to end it."
"There is a long history of mistakes in capital punishment, especially when it comes to Black and Brown people. Rodney Reed's execution should be halted—and it's time to end the death penalty for good."
Well-connected billionaires are given plenty of space to complain about my #TwoCentWealthTax. Let's give more space to the stories of working-class and middle-class families whose lives would be transformed by Universal Child Care and free public college.
"I'll be making more calls to grassroots donors soon! Chip in whatever you can now, and you could get a call from me to say thank you. We can only do this together:"
"Small-dollar donation by small-dollar donation, grassroots donors are powering our campaign. I'm grateful for everyone who chips in what they can to our campaign, and grateful that @JVN was able to give some of you a call to say thanks! Me, you, Jonathan—we're in this together."
"My daddy couldn’t work after his heart attack. We lost the family station wagon, and we nearly lost the house. But my mother got a minimum wage job at Sears that saved our house.

Today, a minimum wage job can’t support a family of three. I'm fighting so every family can succeed."
"Thank you to everyone who came out to our Goose Creek town hall, and thank you to everyone who stayed for the photo line!

South Carolina is ready for the big, structural change we’re fighting for together."
"When I set up the CFPB, I made protecting service members and veterans from scams and predatory lenders a priority.

As president, I'll strengthen the CFPB to protect our military families. They shouldn't have to worry about their families while they're protecting our country."
"Our campaign is by the people, for the people—and we’re growing one small-dollar donation at a time! I was glad that @JVN called some grassroots donors to say thank you this week. Here he is, talking to Lauren!"
"Generation after generation, communities of color have been devastated by environmental racism. At last night’s #EJPresForum, I spoke about how my environmental justice plan will lift up the Black and Brown families who have been left behind."
"Fortunately, they can both use my calculator to find out exactly how much they’d have to chip in under my #TwoCentWealthTax:"
"One billionaire calls another billionaire and asks him to run for president—I'm shocked! Here's the deal: Companies like Amazon have too much power, and billionaires like @JeffBezos and @MikeBloomberg should pitch in so that everyone can succeed."
"It is disgraceful and dangerous that Republicans are holding up the VAWA reauthorization to allow those convicted of stalking to keep their guns.

Domestic violence and gun violence are deeply connected—we need to keep guns out of the hands of abusers."
Journalists do important work under increasingly difficult circumstances—from private equity takeovers to attacks from Trump. I'll always stand with workers and unions like @GMGUnion fighting for their rights. We must protect the right to join a union and strengthen union voices.
"Nuestro país le hizo una promesa a más de 700,000 personas de poder ir a la universidad, trabajar, y cuidar a sus familias, sin tener miedo de ser deportados. Donald Trump rompió esa promesa. Pero estamos alzando nuestra voz y luchando para defender DACA. #HomeIsHere"

"Generation after generation, communities of color have been devastated by environmental racism. At last night’s #EJPresForum, I spoke about how my environmental justice plan will lift up the Black and Brown families who have been left behind."
"Fortunately, they can both use my calculator to find out exactly how much they’d have to chip in under my #TwoCentWealthTax:"
"One billionaire calls another billionaire and asks him to run for president—I'm shocked! Here's the deal: Companies like Amazon have too much power, and billionaires like @JeffBezos and @MikeBloomberg should pitch in so that everyone can succeed."
"It is disgraceful and dangerous that Republicans are holding up the VAWA reauthorization to allow those convicted of stalking to keep their guns.

Domestic violence and gun violence are deeply connected—we need to keep guns out of the hands of abusers."
Journalists do important work under increasingly difficult circumstances—from private equity takeovers to attacks from Trump. I'll always stand with workers and unions like @GMGUnion fighting for their rights. We must protect the right to join a union and strengthen union voices.
".@YuhLine and I are fighting for big, structural change—and that includes building a future in which women always have a seat at the table, and young girls see themselves represented in our government."
"30 years ago, Berliners came together to tear down the wall that had divided their city. We are still inspired today by their brave protest and pursuit of freedom and unity—and we recommit ourselves to a Europe that is united, democratic, and at peace."
"Apparently, a few billionaires don't like my #TwoCentWealthTax. But here's the deal—if you made it big, you should chip in two cents to make sure that everyone else can make it, too."
Coopermans support candidates who will fight for people like them—and I've got a lot more Coopermans on my side.
"It's time to put power in the hands of the people. Grateful my friend @AyannaPressley could join me in North Carolina as we fight for big, structural change!"
"Congratulations to everyone who had their right to vote restored today! Now, let’s keep fighting to protect our fundamental right to vote."
"One year ago this week, women were elected to office in record numbers. One year from today, we’ll have a chance to make history again. If we want to make big, structural change, we need to elect another wave of women up and down the ballot."
Fighting for the #GreenNewDeal is the right thing to do. When Democrats aren’t afraid to fight for big ideas—we win.
"Good. 

The status quo is working great for the wealthy and the well-connected, but not so much for everyone else. Big, structural change is coming—and I’m not afraid to fight for it."
"I’m still waiting. Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition with the possible future leaders of our party—and how much it costs. We can talk all we want about how to get big money out of politics, but nothing will change unless we start leading the way."
"Last month, I called on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, and to disclose the dates and locations of their fundraising events and the names of every person who appears on their host committees."
"I'm running a grassroots campaign. I don't take money from federal lobbyists or PACs, and I don't take contributions over $200 from fossil fuel, Big Pharma, Big Banks, or Big Tech executives. And I’m not doing call time with wealthy donors or giving them special access."
"I loved reading your father’s letter, Michelle. Thank you both so much for being part of our movement—stay strong out there!"
".@KatiePorterOC and I both know what it's like to watch our families come close to skidding off a financial cliff. It's time to make sure our government works for families again. I'm proud to be fighting alongside her for big, structural change."
"The wealthy and well-connected will always have each other's backs. We're building a movement to change that. We're building a movement for big, structural change."
"We make many kinds of promises—promises to ourselves, to others, and promises for our future. When I make a pinkie promise with young girls, we promise to run for office, to help elect more women, and to build a future in which women always have a seat at the table."
"LGBTQ+ people need and deserve equitable, gender-affirming, and culturally-competent health care, no matter where they live. And I've got a plan for that."
I'm glad that Mark is finally getting his wheelchair—but no one should have to publicly shame an insurance company to get the care they need. We need #MedicareForAll.
"See you soon, Atlanta!"
"Grateful for the opportunity to be part of #OnOneWithAngelaRye at @ncatsuaggies today. My friend @AyannaPressley led our conversation about the big, structural change we must make to level the playing field for every Black family in our country. Thanks for having me, @Angela_Rye!"

"Bruce and I had the opportunity to visit the Woolworth's Lunch Counter at the International Civil Rights Center and Museum in Greensboro.

Courageous young activists ignited a movement against segregation. Now it's our responsibility to carry on their fight for racial justice."
"The wealthy and the well-connected can get all the airtime they want to complain about my #TwoCentWealthTax—but we've got the power of a movement. So share your stories about what child care, good public schools, and universal free college would mean for you."
And this calculator can show you how much of your student loan debt would be cancelled under my plan:
"And yeah, we've got calculators for those plans too! See how much you could save on child care under my plan for universal child care:"
"—Universal child care
—Invest in public K-12 schools
—Cancel student loan debt
—Universal free public college and technical schools

This would make a real, tangible difference in the lives of millions of American families."
"Billionaires get so much airtime to talk about how they don't want to pay more taxes. Instead, let’s talk about what a #TwoCentWealthTax would mean for middle-class and working-class families."
"My heart goes out to @DenzelCummings’ family and friends. He was thoughtful, intentional, and compassionate, and my entire team and I are deeply saddened by his passing."
"It's time to put power in the hands of the people. @AyannaPressley and I are fighting for the big, structural change that our country needs."
"Welcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg! If you're looking for policy plans that will make a huge difference for working people and which are very popular, start here:"
"The time for small ideas is over.
We need big ideas that can fix the big challenges that we face.
We need big ideas that can inspire people.
We need big ideas that will bring people out to vote. 
And we need someone willing to fight for those big ideas."
"I stand with the @Teamsters25 sanitation drivers on strike. They deserve a living wage, and Republic Services must negotiate with them in good faith."
"Many of these workers have gone without a raise for nearly a decade while getting squeezed by rising health insurance costs. I stand with @Teamsters and @Steelworkers who are going on strike to demand fair wages, good health care, and labor protections."
"Some billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under my #TwoCentWealthTax. Don’t worry, we've got a calculator for that, too. 

The bottom line: If you made it big, you should chip in to make sure everyone else also has a chance to succeed:"
"Thank you, @BlackWomxnFor! Black trans and cis women, gender-nonconforming, and nonbinary people are the backbone of our democracy and I don’t take this endorsement lightly. I'm committed to fighting alongside you for the big, structural change our country needs."
".@TMobile and @Sprint’s merger will stifle competition, costing thousands of jobs, reducing wages, and giving consumers fewer options. We need a government willing to stand up to these monopolies and protect consumers."
Far too many of our veterans and service members die by suicide. Every single one is a tragedy that could have been prevented. I've got a plan to cut the number of veteran suicides in half in my first term.
"While millions of McDonald’s workers are living paycheck to paycheck, their fired CEO gets to leave with millions of dollars in his pocket. 

The economy is working great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. We need big, structural change."
We aren't going to get farmers the resources they need or challenge the stigma around mental health and suicide if Republicans refuse to confront the problem. Farmers need action—now.
"My family lived on the ragged edge of the middle-class. When my daddy had a heart attack, it nearly sent us over a financial cliff. Today, the cost of health care is the number one reason why families go broke. No more. We need #MedicareForAll."
"I'm always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views. @BillGates, if we get the chance, I'd love to explain exactly how much you'd pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it's not $100 billion.)"

Congratulations to @KendraForPhilly on winning her election to the Philadelphia City Council! Her passion and commitment will make real change for Philadelphia’s working families.
"When I was a young mom, child care nearly knocked me off track. My Aunt Bee saved me, but not every family has an Aunt Bee who can step in. I remember the stress and fear I felt. That's why I'm fighting to build a future in which every young family has a chance to succeed."
"The Veterans Health Administration has pioneered innovations in medical care and provides high-quality, evidence-based, culturally competent programs that our veterans rely on. I won't let it be privatized. I've got a plan to invest in it."
"Power belongs in the hands of the people. I'm proud to fight alongside @AyannaPressley for the big, structural change that we need."
No student should have to learn in an environment where there's a threat of incarceration. I've got plans to close the school to prison pipeline and ensure every student has a safe and welcoming place to learn.
Insurance companies make their profit by refusing coverage. We need #MedicareForAll because no one’s health care should depend on whether they can shame an insurance company.
"Congratulations to @PWCDanica on winning re-election! I admire your dedication to the people of your district, and am inspired by your commitment to making infrastructure a priority in Virginia."

"Congratulations to @TucsonRomero on her historic election as the first Latina and first woman mayor of Tucson, Arizona! Regina is a champion for our environment and working families—and I'm looking forward to the big, structural change she'll bring to her community."
I’m glad to see @Shelly_Simonds win her seat in the House of Delegates. She will be a real fighter for working families in coastal Virginia—and there’s no need for a hat draw when the people of Virginia vote and make their voices heard! #FlipVABlue

"Iran’s decision to restart enrichment at Fordow is deeply concerning. Before Donald Trump ripped it up, the Iran Deal was working. We must return to serious diplomacy with allies to constrain Iran’s nuclear program and de-escalate the crisis."

"The fact that they've reacted so strongly—so angrily!—to being asked to chip in more tells you all you need to know. The system is working great for the wealthy and well-connected, and Jamie Dimon doesn't want that to change. I'm going to fight to make sure it works for everyone."

Twitter's new ad policy will allow fossil fuel companies to buy ads defending themselves and spreading misleading info—but won't allow organizations fighting the climate crisis to buy ads holding those companies accountable. We need accountability.
"All three of my brothers served, so I understand the responsibility we have to honor our promises to our service members and veterans. I've got a plan to invest in the VA—not privatize it."
"My plan to protect our democracy directly targets this type of racist voting suppression. We will have federal standards to ensure everyone can vote—and where racist or corrupt politicians refuse to follow the law, the federal government will step in."
"This isn't just an inconvenience—long lines and delays prevent people from voting, and it isn't a surprise or secret that racist and corrupt politicians have allowed these problems to suppress the vote in minority communities."
It's simple: #MedicareForAll is the best way to ensure that everyone gets the care they need and that no one ever goes broke because of health care costs.
"By leaving the Paris Climate Agreement, Trump is ceding American leadership and giving away American jobs in the clean energy economy of the future. We should be leading the fight to end the climate crisis—and I've got a plan for that."

"Finally, my administration will invest in the VA and reject attempts to privatize it. Under #MedicareForAll, veterans will also have the option to get high-quality health care from non-VA doctors and hospitals at no additional cost."
"My administration will ease the transition of veterans leaving military service and help prepare them to return to civilian life. We’ll create a seamless transition from the DOD to the VA, eliminate the benefits backlog, and expand career opportunities for our vets."
"A Warren administration will protect the rights of LGBTQ+, women, Black, and Latinx service members. I'll reverse Trump's shameful ban on trans service members on Day One. My administration will protect veterans and family members of serving military personnel from deportation."
"We must ensure the safety of those who serve or have served in uniform. I'll fight to eliminate military sexual assault, expand mental health services and work to end military and veteran suicide, and treat the opioid and addiction crisis."
"Military families are the backbone of our armed forces, but they face unique challenges. I'll prioritize military spouse employment, ensure families have high-quality child care and education, provide safe and affordable housing, and protect wounded warriors and their caregivers."

"We can honor our veterans by ending endless wars, reining in our bloated defense budget and reducing the influence of defense contractors at the Pentagon, and bringing our troops home responsibly—and then providing our veterans with the benefits they’ve earned."

"All three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has towards military personnel and their families. Today, I'm sharing my plan to honor our promises to our nation’s veterans, service members, military families, and survivors."
Happy #ElectionDay to all the states holding elections! Today’s our chance to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. Find your polling place at   and head to the polls to make your voice heard—make sure to bring your friends and family!
"Our democracy shouldn’t be bought and paid for by the wealthy and powerful. I stand with Seattle council members, activists, and voters who are standing up to Amazon. It's time to get big money out of politics."

We need to be strengthening our response to climate change—but Trump and his administration are running away from our responsibilities. I'll move to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of my presidency.

I care about an entire generation of students being crushed by student loan debt—deferring their American dream because they can't afford it. I care about making sure every American has the opportunity to succeed. I'm not afraid to stand up to the wealthy and well-connected.
"One thing I know he cares about—his fortune. He's a shareholder in Navient, a student loan company that has cheated borrowers and used abusive, misleading tactics. He even went so far as to ask how I might impact his investment in the last earnings call with Navient."
"37 million people didn’t fill a prescription last year.
36 million people skipped a recommended test or treatment.
40 million people didn’t go to a doctor to check on a health issue.

Even with insurance, costs keep people from getting the care they need. We need #MedicareForAll."
"The Trump administration's expanded global gag rule has had catastrophic affects worldwide, leaving millions without access to safe reproductive health care. When I'm president, I'll overturn the global gag rule and protect reproductive health care."
"No one should avoid seeing a doctor because they don’t have insurance—or because the cost, even with insurance, is too high. This is why we need #MedicareForAll."
"Wall Street is scared because the status quo is working great for them—but we know it's not working so great for everyone else. I'm not afraid to fight for a country where everyone can succeed, not just the wealthy and well-connected."
It shouldn't take a federal court to see Trump's tax returns. I've got a plan to require presidential candidates to release at least eight years of their tax returns—so voters can hold candidates accountable.

"2020 is our moment in history—our moment to dream big, fight hard, and win! #LJ19"
"I did my homework, and I got the experts to check my math. My plan to pay for #MedicareForAll will ensure everyone has full health coverage and put $11 trillion back in the pockets of American families. Here's how."

"Today, I’m releasing my plan to pay for #MedicareForAll. Here’s the headline: My plan won't raise taxes one penny on middle-class families. In fact, we'll return about $11 TRILLION to the American people. That's bigger than the biggest tax cut in our history. Here's how:"

Industrial pollution has been disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities and communities of color like in Louisiana's Cancer Alley. We need to be reducing harmful emissions—not permitting more. These communities need environmental justice.
I love when math teachers take a look at my plans—the math checks out!
"Thanks for being in this fight for big, structural change, @PGSittenfeld! We’re going to do this together."
"A person's wealth shouldn't determine the amount of time they can spend with me—or any other presidential candidate.

That’s why our campaign is funded with small dollar donations. Will you chip in $3 now before our October fundraising deadline?"
"Thanks, @jvn! Calling grassroots donors is one of my favorite things to do—you're going to love it."
Rising sea levels will be catastrophic for coastal cities. Our climate is in crisis and the time to act is now.
"I applaud my colleagues in the House for passing a resolution acknowledging and condemning the Armenian genocide. If we don’t recognize the horrors of the past, we risk repeating them in the future. We must honor the victims and pledge: Never again."
"Uber, Lyft, and Doordash are prepared to spend millions pushing a ballot measure to undermine California's new protections for gig workers. We should all fight these companies' attempts to wield their wealth to block protections for their workers."
"I’m so grateful to have you on #TeamWarren, @ZachWahls! Together, we’ll make the big, structural change our country needs."
"I’m proud to be fighting alongside @Krasner4DA for criminal justice reform and an economy that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected."
I'm running to be the best president that money can't buy—but I can't do it alone. Will you chip in $3 to help grow our campaign? We’ve only got two more days before our big October fundraising deadline.
"Giant corporations shouldn't be able to rig the system by scooping up government officials to get favorable treatment. So I'll ban them from hiring senior government officials for at least four years after they leave office. And if they break these rules, they'll have to pay up."
"I gave up on not offending big donors and giant corporations a long time ago—because when we have big ideas, we get out there and fight for them.

I'm not afraid, and for Democrats to win in 2020, you can't be afraid, either. That’s how we'll make real change."
"Person by person, community by community, we're building a grassroots movement to make our government work for the people.

But I can’t do it alone. Chip in $3 and join the fight—and I might call you to say thanks!"
Communities are tired of seeing families torn apart and immigrants and asylum seekers detained—and they're speaking out. It's time to end unnecessary detention.
This is a good start. Now it's time to allow them to join a union—and get paid.
"GM, Toyota, and Fiat should know better than this. The American auto industry should be leading the way to reduce emissions, not siding with the Trump administration to further pollute our communities."
We have to break the political influence of giant corporations and federal contractors on our government. I’ve got a plan for that.
"Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify. It's time to end these arbitrary, undemocratic voter purges."
"It's time to put power in the hands of working people—not just a select wealthy few.

That's why our campaign is people-funded: No fancy fundraisers, no PACs, and no special interest groups.

Chip in $3 right now to own a piece of this campaign."
"This is corruption, plain and simple—and I’ve got a plan to end it."
"This proposal comes from, of all places, a commission meant to improve our democracy. But attacking the @NYWFP is deeply undemocratic—and it will only benefit Republicans. No Democrat should allow this to pass."
"Executives have made it clear they're ready to “go to the mat” to fight, but that’s not how our economy or our democracy is supposed to work. Together, we’ll close the revolving door and break the grip of giant corporations on our economy and our government."

"Giant corporations shouldn't be able to rig the system by scooping up government officials to get favorable treatment. I'll ban giant federal contractors, banks, and market-dominant companies from hiring senior government officials for at least four years after they leave office."
It's not just Facebook. Giant corporations regularly hire people from their government regulators to leverage their connections and use the allure of future jobs to get favorable treatment. It’s no wonder these companies have consolidated power without any real accountability.
Facebook is now spending millions on lobbying amid antitrust scrutiny—and Kaplan is flexing his DC rolodex to help Mark Zuckerbeg wage a closed-door charm offensive with Republican lawmakers.
"Two years after serving as George W. Bush’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Joel Kaplan was hired by Facebook as its Vice President for US Public Policy. Since he was hired, Facebook spent over $71 million on lobbying—nearly 100 times what it had spent before Kaplan joined."
"Giant market-dominant companies like Facebook, Pfizer, and Comcast strategically hire senior government officials who can leverage their contacts for corporate gain. If we want to root out Washington corruption, that must end—and I've got a plan."
"I'm not taking a dime from federal lobbyists, corporate PACs, or PACs of any kind—because our campaign is powered by the people, not special interest groups with Big Money to spend.

Chip in now and I might just call with a big “Thank you!”"
"I'm grateful down to my toes for your support, @johnlegend! Looking forward to the day @chrissyteigen doesn't have to fight with the president of the United States on Twitter."
Good. Now it's time to end all ICE contracts with private detention providers. No one should profit off of our inhumane immigration policies.
Facebook's own employees know just how dangerous their policy allowing politicians to lie in political ads will be for our democracy. Mark Zuckerberg should listen to them—and I applaud their brave efforts to hold their own company accountable.
"I've been a teacher, a law professor, a senator, and a candidate for president of the United States thanks to the opportunities a public education gave me. 

Today's your last chance to get our free sticker to show you're #PublicSchoolProud!"

"Senator Kay Hagan was a tireless fighter for women, veterans, and military families, and a dear friend and colleague. I'm heartsick for Kay's family and friends."
"Frances Perkins saw what was broken in our country and had a plan to fix it. One woman—backed by millions of people—was able to make big, structural change. And we can do it again in 2020."
John Conyers fought to make our government work for Black Americans as a civil rights leader and co-founder of @TheBlackCaucus—and that important work continues to inspire us. I’m keeping him and his loved ones in my thoughts.
"Our students shouldn’t have to worry about where they’ll get their next meal. Under my public school plan, we’ll cancel student breakfast and lunch debt and provide free and nutritious school meals so our kids can succeed in school."
"When someone is sent into our criminal justice system, it's not a single person. When a person is arrested, we have to think about how that pulls their entire family into the system—and how that family is treated."
"Thank you @BenedictEDU students for asking important questions at the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum. 

We can start to fix our criminal justice system by investing not in incarceration, but in services that lift communities up. My plan for that:"

"Thank you, Florence! Shoulder to shoulder, I believe we can dream big, fight hard, and win."
"(2/2) Baghdadi's death closes one chapter, but it is not the end of our fight against terrorism. We need a settlement that ends the suffering and destruction in Syria—and ultimately, a long-term plan to counter extremism and allow the region to achieve peace and stability."
(1/2) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi led a campaign of mass violence and terror that devastated the region and threatened the world. His death is a setback for ISIS and a victory for justice. I am grateful for the skill and courage of our special operations and intelligence professionals.

Get your free sticker if you haven’t already:"

Climate change is driving devastating wildfires across California—and these fires will only grow more dangerous and destructive until we act to stop the climate crisis.
"This is appalling. ICE needs to be held accountable for Roxsana Hernández's death, and for destroying evidence related to her death."
It was delicious.
And those are just a few examples of Trump’s corruption. This administration is the most corrupt of our lifetime. It’s time to root out Washington corruption—and I’ve got a plan for that.
The corruption goes a lot deeper than one hotel. Foreign governments funnel money into Trump's pockets from many of his hotels and properties. He appoints Mar-a-Lago members as our ambassadors. He tried to host the G-7 summit at his Doral property.

Seeing @NikkiFried's leadership in Florida gives me hope. Nikki has proven to Floridians the difference it makes when we elect Democrats and elevate women up and down the ticket.
Good. Betsy DeVos needs to be held accountable—and we need a secretary of education willing to fight for students.

"I’ve got your back, Noor. Every kid should be able to feel safe and welcome at school—and Muslim students should never be denied participation in school activities. My public school plan fights discriminatory dress codes that exclude students like Noor."
We should fight back against measures that criminalize homelessness—not propose ones that will only perpetuate it. I'll fight to make sure those experiencing homelessness get affordable housing and access to the services they need.

"I'll move to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on day one of my presidency. We need to strengthen our response to the climate crisis, not run away from it.

America is at its best when we dream big and fight hard, and we must fight hard to defeat the climate crisis together."
American diplomacy was critical in bringing the world together to adopt the Paris Climate Agreement and commit to fighting climate change. Pulling the U.S. out of this deal threatens our security and economy—and our ability to fight climate change.

"For some candidates, “call time” means asking millionaires and billionaires for big checks.

That’s not how we do things on #TeamWarren. I spend “call time” thanking grassroots supporters and talking with voters. Chip in $3, and I might call to say thanks!"

Communities of color on the front lines of the climate crisis have faced generations of industrial pollution. Their voices must be centered in the fight against climate change—and the fight for environmental justice.
Trump's unqualified Mar-a-Lago member-ambassadors are undermining our diplomats and damaging our reputation abroad. It's time to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to political cronies and wealthy donors.
A Wall Street billionaire shouldn't be paying a lower tax rate than a middle class family struggling to get by. It's time for a #TwoCentWealthTax on the wealthiest families in America.
"Thank you, Jim! Grateful down to my toes to have you on #TeamWarren."
Your stories give me hope and joy. I firmly believe in our public schools. That’s why I’m working to ensure high-quality public school education for all kids—and I’m fighting to get it done:
Everyone deserves equal pay for equal work. It's time to end the subminimum wage for people with disabilities. I'll fight for free vocational training to help people with disabilities get good-paying jobs.
"I'm not afraid to fight for big, structural change—and neither are the people of Cedar Falls. Thanks for being part of this grassroots movement!"

"I became a teacher, a law professor, a senator, and a candidate for president of the United States—all with the tools that a public education gave me. (Yes, that’s me in elementary school!) Share your school photos and why you're #PublicSchoolProud."
"I'll say it again: This is corruption, plain and simple. Donald Trump must be impeached."
Parents would do anything to ensure their children have a fair shot in life—and I want to help. That's why I've got a plan to make sure every kid can get a high-quality public education that sets them up for success.
"Our public schools are more segregated today than they were thirty years ago. 

I'll renew the fight against segregation by helping integrate our communities—and by strengthening and robustly enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
"Far too many families have lost loved ones because of inadequate or negligent care. We need to end unnecessary detention, ensure those in custody receive medical care, and end contracts with private detention providers."
"For some candidates, “call time” means asking millionaires and billionaires for big checks.

That’s not how we do things on #TeamWarren. I spend “call time” thanking grassroots supporters and talking with voters. Chip in $3, and I might call to say thanks!"
"Virginia, you have an election coming up very soon—and if you want to get rid of ridiculously gerrymandered districts like these, make sure to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot."
"There are a lot of incredible women that keep @TeamWarren running, but life on the campaign trail wouldn't be nearly as fun without my Waffle House partner, @ItsPearcey!"
"Facebook let me run an ad saying Mark Zuckerberg endorsed Donald Trump for reelection, so I’d say you probably could, @AOC. I imagine Republicans would be a lot more concerned about fact-checking Facebook ads after that."
"Leon, you were able to succeed because of the opportunities this country gave you. Now why don’t you pitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream, too?"
Communities of color on the front lines of the climate crisis have faced generations of industrial pollution. Their voices must be centered in the fight against climate change—and the fight for environmental justice.
Trump's unqualified Mar-a-Lago member-ambassadors are undermining our diplomats and damaging our reputation abroad. It's time to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to political cronies and wealthy donors.
A Wall Street billionaire shouldn't be paying a lower tax rate than a middle class family struggling to get by. It's time for a #TwoCentWealthTax on the wealthiest families in America.
"Thank you, Jim! Grateful down to my toes to have you on #TeamWarren."
Your stories give me hope and joy. I firmly believe in our public schools. That’s why I’m working to ensure high-quality public school education for all kids—and I’m fighting to get it done:
Everyone deserves equal pay for equal work. It's time to end the subminimum wage for people with disabilities. I'll fight for free vocational training to help people with disabilities get good-paying jobs.
"I'm not afraid to fight for big, structural change—and neither are the people of Cedar Falls. Thanks for being part of this grassroots movement!"
"Let’s be clear: Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional right. Every time we deny access to safe, legal abortion, we put lives in danger. I’ve got a plan to protect our reproductive health care in every state. #StopTheBansSC"

"A new bulletproof memorial marking Emmett Till’s brutal lynching was installed this week after multiple markers were previously stolen, vandalized, and shot. Racist attacks are not just a part of our history—they are a part of our present, too."
".@CTULocal1 and @SEIU73 are fighting for their students and their schools, and I'm marching shoulder-to-shoulder alongside them. They need resources—and they need a #FairContractNow. #PutItInWriting"
"Today, I went to Chicago to stand with the teachers on strike. They’re fighting for our children and for America's future—and I'm with them every step of the way."
"Lynching is a horrific stain on our country's history, and it is beyond disgraceful for Donald Trump to invoke one to avoid being held accountable for his crimes.

Nobody is above the law, not even the president of the United States."
It’s time to live up to our promise of providing every student with a great public education.
Climate change is an existential threat—and it's time for companies to reveal their emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. My Climate Risk Disclosure Act will require companies to publicly disclose their role in contributing to the climate crisis.
"Thank you, Ames! Together we'll dream big, fight hard, and build the grassroots movement we need to win."
"Betsy DeVos refers to public schools as a ""dead end.""

I believe in public schools, and I'll fight for them with everything I’ve got. #PublicSchoolProud"

I want to make sure that every kid in America can get a high-quality public education. Thanks to the students at Roosevelt High School for our conversation about how we can improve our public schools! #PublicSchoolProud
"While the top 0.1% of American households sit on massive amounts of wealth, millions of families are living paycheck to paycheck.

It's time for the wealthiest families to pitch in so everyone can succeed."
I believe in public schools. I want to hear why public school is important to you—why you're #PublicSchoolProud.
"We've worked hard, sharing plans and building a grassroots movement. And yesterday, we reached a new milestone—two million donations!"
"I attended public school. I taught at public schools. Public school made me. 

If a public school made you, too, we’ve got a sticker for that! Get your free sticker now:"
This is cruel and punitive. Every kid needs and deserves a nutritious meal in order to learn at school. My plan will push to cancel student breakfast and lunch debt and increase funding to school meals programs so all students can get a nutritious meal.
"I support the Lebanese people protesting and demanding their government take care of all of its people, not just the rich and powerful. As we fight corruption in our home, we should support those fighting corruption in theirs."
Our public school teachers are fighting for their students and their schools. They deserve better pay and resources. I'll protect and strengthen their ability to organize and bargain collectively. #PublicSchoolProud
"It's time to live up to the promise of a high-quality public education for every student. My plan makes big, structural changes that would help give every student the resources that they need to thrive."
"We must stop the privatization of public schools. My administration will end federal funding for the expansion of charter schools, ban for-profit charter schools, and ensure existing charter schools are held to the same level of transparency and accountability as public schools."
"My administration will work with states to sustainably increase the pay of teachers, paraprofessionals, school staff, and school leaders, and ensure that they have the resources they need. And I'll strengthen their ability to organize and bargain collectively."

"Next, I'll make sure that we fund schools adequately and equitably by quadrupling Title I funding—investing an additional $450 billion over the next 10 years—and working with public education leaders and school finance experts to ensure that this money is allocated equitably."
"I’ll start—as I promised in May—by replacing Betsy DeVos with a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher, believes in public education, and will listen to our public school teachers, parents, and students."
"Funding for public schools is inadequate and inequitable, and our schools are more segregated now than decades ago. We don't treat teachers and staff like professionals, and we're diverting money from public schools. It's time to live up to our promise of a good public education."

"I'm grateful down to my toes for every single contribution to this grassroots movement. This is how we're going to win—by fighting together for big, structural change."
Communities on the front lines of climate change deserve justice—and voices like Theresa Landrum's are the ones that should be leading the conversation as we fight for our clean energy future.
I called Chicago teachers on strike to let them know I'm standing beside them. They're out fighting for the future of our students—and I'm with them all the way. #PutItInWriting #FairContractNow
"Keep fighting, Brandon. The work you are doing is so important, and I’ll fight alongside you."
"Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me, Rebecca! Stay strong out there."

"Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh—we must call it out, and I have a plan to fight back:"
"The G-7 may no longer be at Trump National Doral, but that won’t stop foreign nations from dumping money into Donald Trump's pockets by spending at his hotels. And it won’t stop Trump from rewarding Mar-a-Lago members with ambassadorships."
"We don't need fancy fundraisers, corporate PACs, or federal lobbyists to win in 2020—we just need this grassroots movement.

Justice cannot be an afterthought in our fight against climate change—it must be central to our fight."
"Surprise: Amazon is trying to tilt the Seattle City Council elections in their favor. I'm with the Seattle council members and activists who continue standing up to Amazon. Corporations aren't people, and I have a plan to get big money out of politics."

"The time for small ideas is over. When we dream big and fight hard, we can win. Thank you, Norfolk!"

We must end unnecessary detention and enforce strict standards to keep trans migrants and asylum seekers safe—and I'll continue holding our government accountable when they fail to do so."
We have to protect Black trans women—and we have to fight gun violence. I'm heartsick for Brianna Hill and her friends and family.
"Abusing diplomatic relationships for personal, political gain.
Appointing Mar-a-Lago members as our ambassadors.
Hosting the G-7 Summit at one of his properties.

The Trump administration is the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes."

Chip in $3 now to help make our goal, and I could call you to say thanks."
Facebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again—and profit off of it.
"Here's the thing, Mark. Trump isn't just posting a lie on his own page for his own followers. Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies. Ads that TV stations won't even run."

"This is corruption, plain and simple."
We need to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors and get big money out of politics. I've got a plan for that.
"Gordon Sondland will be testifying today about how Donald Trump abused our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain. He donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee before he was appointed to this position."
"Good people everywhere will miss his rumbling voice, his kind heart, and his deep conviction that every human being has worth. Rest in power, Elijah."
"Rep. Elijah Cummings was a giant in the House, an unwavering champion for his district and all Americans, and a dear friend. My heart goes out to his wife Maya and his family."
"Climate change is a threat—but it's also an opportunity to strengthen unions, tackle income inequality, and create millions of good jobs here in America. Here's my plan to meet the goals of the #GreenNewDeal and invest in green manufacturing:"
"There wasn't a single question during the #DemDebate about climate change. Families are suffering with poisoned air and water, cancer, chronic health conditions—and it's communities of color who suffer the most. Families on the front lines of the climate crisis need action now."
"Thank you Krishan, I’m grateful down to my toes to have you on #TeamWarren!"
"Thank you, Shauna! We’re going to win this together."
"Thank you, Nathan! Together we’re going to make the big, structural change we need."

Corruption in Washington is holding back progress—and much of it is perfectly legal thanks to the Supreme Court. It’s time to get big money out of politics and put power back in the hands of the people—and I've got a plan for that.

"This is a start, but voluntary changes aren’t going to be enough to clean up the corruption in our elections. That’s why when I’m president, I’ll implement a comprehensive plan to permanently eliminate big money from our politics and return our democracy to the people."
Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition with the possible future leaders of our party—and how much it costs. So I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign.
"Today, I’m announcing that in addition to these policies, I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds. My campaign is and will continue to be a grassroots campaign."
"My campaign doesn’t take money from federal lobbyists or PACs, and I don't take contributions over $200 from fossil fuel or big pharma executives. No call time with rich donors or giving them special access. And when I’m the Democratic nominee, that won't change."
Corruption in Washington is holding back progress—and much of it is perfectly legal thanks to the Supreme Court. It’s time to get big money out of politics and put power back in the hands of the people—and I've got a plan for that.
"Edith Espinal has lived in the United States for decades, raising a family and building a community. And the Trump administration wants to deport her

Stay strong, @LetEdithStay. When I'm president, I will protect asylum seekers."
I really do love my boa! Thanks @SheaCoulee and @NVforWarren—I had so much fun at Las Vegas Pride with you.
Black and Latinx families are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of air pollution than white families. Environmental justice must be at the center of our response to climate change.
"Just over six months ago, the Trump administration began implementing Trump's shameful ban on transgender service members. When I am president, I will reverse this policy on day one."
We must fulfill our trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. We must protect Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. And we have to go even further to empower indigenous peoples to build stronger communities and a brighter future.
"The story of America’s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient. We owe them our respect—and we must honor our government's commitments and promises to them. #IndigenousPeoplesDay"
"Sorry, @RobCorddry! Thanks for joining me on @ColbertLateShow. I'll miss seeing you and @TheRock on @BallersHBO. Congratulations on five incredible seasons!"
"In the community of Rosemont in Charleston, South Carolina, climate change and a century of industrial pollution has hit families of color first and worst. I have a plan to fight our crisis of environmental injustice."
"Atatiana Jefferson should still be alive. We need real reform, now—including federal standards for the use of force that incorporate proven strategies like de-escalation, verbal warning requirements, and the use of non-lethal alternatives."
"Companies shifted their resources and strategies because of Facebook's inflated metrics, costing them money and contributing to job losses. We need to do a lot more to hold Facebook accountable."
"Thank you, @TheJeffreyMarsh. I want to make sure everyone's needs are reflected in my plans, and that your voices are uplifted. Thanks for being on #TeamWarren."
"Let’s be clear: 2020 is our chance to root out corruption in Washington and return power to the people.

But that means we’ll need everyone pitching in to keep building our movement. Donate to our grassroots campaign, and let’s do this together."
"You’re making my point here. It’s up to you whether you take money to promote lies. You can be in the disinformation-for-profit business, or you can hold yourself to some standards. In fact, those standards were in your policy. Why the change?"
"Hemos hecho enormes avances hacia la igualdad para los estadounidenses LGBTQ+. Pero ese progreso está en peligro, y la lucha hacia la igualdad aún no termina. Lucharé junto a organizadores y líderes del movimiento hasta que cada persona LGBTQ+ pueda prosperar sin discriminación."

"Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once through negligence. Now, they've changed their policy so they can profit from lies to the American people. It's time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable—add your name if you agree:"
"The Trump campaign is currently spending $1 million a *week* on ads including ones containing known lies—ads that TV stations refuse to air because they’re false. Facebook just takes the cash, no questions asked."
"Once again, we’re seeing Facebook throw its hands up to battling misinformation in the political discourse, because when profit comes up against protecting democracy, Facebook chooses profit."
Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They’ve decided to let political figures lie to you—even about Facebook itself—while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies.
We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook’s ad platform to see if it’d be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook. Take a look:
"Facebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies—explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine. This week, we decided to see just how far it goes."
"I loved meeting Antonio, the winner of our Las Vegas Pride contest! Antonio lives right here in Nevada, and I'm glad he's in this fight with me for big, structural change."
Now let’s ban them everywhere.
"This is excellent news! Families shouldn't be penalized for needing food, housing, or health care."
"Amazon has used their immense power to limit competition, undercut small businesses, and boost their own products and profits.

You can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both in the same game. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech."
"My job is to be strong for little girls—to show them that when you fight for what you believe in, you can win. And they make me stronger, too. #DayOfTheGirl"
"We must take proactive steps to secure LGBTQ+ rights by passing the Equality Act. And in my first 100 days as president, I will use every legal tool to ensure that LGBTQ+ people can live free from discrimination."
"Happy #ComingOutDay to everyone—whether you're coming out today, you've been out for a while, you're coming out again and again, or if you're not quite ready. You are loved, and we can't wait to lift you up. I'll fight until you are free to live and thrive exactly as you are."
"Private equity firms are sucking value out of our companies, putting people out of work, and wiping out newspapers and digital news outlets like @Splinter_News. I have a plan to hold these firms accountable."
Looking forward to it!
"Whether it’s a 5k or an election—bring it on. Thanks for the question, @ColbertLateShow!"

"I’m going to continue helping the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates everywhere so we have the resources not just to beat Donald Trump but also to win back Congress and state legislatures all across the country. That’s how we’re going to make big, structural change."
"I will also do everything I can to build our party infrastructure and strengthen Democratic candidates up and down the ballot across the country. In 2018, I gave or raised more than $11 million to state and local candidates and parties."
My campaign is and will continue to be a grassroots campaign—funded by working people chipping in a few bucks here and there. Chip in if that's the kind of campaign you think candidates should be running:
"And when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PAC money. No federal lobbyist money. No special access or call time with wealthy donors or high-dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign."
"As part of my campaign, I haven’t been taking PAC money or federal lobbyist money or giving special access to rich donors through call time or high-dollar fundraisers."
"Whatever issue got you into politics, progress is hard because of one thing: Money. Our government works great for the wealthy and well-connected but not for anyone else."
"Trump recklessly betrayed our Kurdish partners and cleared the way for Turkey’s invasion of Syria—reopening the door for ISIS and furthering a humanitarian crisis. We should bring our troops home, but we need to do so in a way that protects our security."
Supreme Court justices should be held to a code of ethics—and held accountable when they fail to live up to it.
"As I’ve traveled this country, I’ve heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water. These communities need justice—and I will stand with them."
"Finally, we will hold corporate polluters accountable for the damage they've done in frontline communities and for their role in the climate crisis. My administration will impose steep fines on violators, which we'll reinvest in impacted communities."
But we must ensure that we honor our commitments to fossil fuel workers as we transition to the new green economy. We'll ensure that new jobs have similar wages and benefits. And I'll fight to protect the pensions and benefits that they've earned.
"As we fight the climate crisis, we have an opportunity to create millions of good-paying American jobs and rebuild our unions. We cannot fight climate change with a low-wage economy. Workers and unions must be our partners in this fight."
"As we work to enact the #GreenNewDeal, I'll make sure that frontline community leaders who know best what their neighborhoods need are elevated in my White House and lead the way toward the big, structural change we need. They've been doing this work for decades—we should listen."
"We need to invest in the communities who have borne the brunt of industrial pollution and are on the front lines of climate change. I'll direct at least $1 trillion to the most vulnerable communities—not just to clean up pollution, but to help them build a more resilient future."
"Industrial pollution has been concentrated in communities of color due to decades of discrimination and racism—and a system that puts corporate profits before people. We need big, structural change, focused on and led by members of those communities."
Justice for communities on the front lines of the climate crisis must be at the core of our response to climate change. Here's my plan for how I'll center environmental justice in the fight to end the climate crisis.
"After I became visibly pregnant, I was told that the job I'd been promised for next year would go to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination is real, and it still happens today—but telling our stories is one way we can fight back. Here are some of your stories that I heard today."
"Congratulations to @StevenLouisReed on his historic election as Montgomery, Alabama's first African American mayor! I can't wait to see the big, structural change you make."

"We need to invest in the communities who have borne the brunt of industrial pollution and are on the front lines of climate change. I'll direct at least $1 trillion to the most vulnerable communities—not just to clean up pollution, but to help them build a more resilient future."
"Industrial pollution has been concentrated in communities of color due to decades of discrimination and racism—and a system that puts corporate profits before people. We need big, structural change, focused on and led by members of those communities."
Justice for communities on the front lines of the climate crisis must be at the core of our response to climate change. Here's my plan for how I'll center environmental justice in the fight to end the climate crisis.
"After I became visibly pregnant, I was told that the job I'd been promised for next year would go to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination is real, and it still happens today—but telling our stories is one way we can fight back. Here are some of your stories that I heard today."
"Pregnancy discrimination in the workplace is illegal—sadly it’s still alarmingly common, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways."
Scientists like Dr. @AyanaEliza are warning us about what can happen if we fail to stop the climate crisis—and many communities are already seeing the effects. Those on the front lines of the climate crisis must lead the way toward a solution.
Our federal judges must be held to the highest ethical standards—and I’ve got a plan for that.
Bruce and I wish a g’mar chatima tovah to everyone observing Yom Kippur. May it be a meaningful fast and a day of personal introspection and reflection.
"Rev. Carey Grady is right—the communities that have suffered the greatest harm must be the ones to lead the way forward. And I'll fight alongside those communities for the big, structural change we need."
"We need a government that's on the side of families—not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution."
"Gordon Sondland, our Ambassador to the European Union, got his job after donating $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee. We need to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors. And I've got a plan for that."
This is obstruction of justice—an impeachable offense.
The Trump administration is arguing that the Supreme Court should undo the progress we've made and let employers fire LGBTQ+ people because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. We need a president that will fight discrimination and protect LGBTQ+ rights. #RiseUpOct8
"This was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination—but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours."
"When I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant—and the principal told me the job I'd already been promised for the next year would go to someone else."
Our legal system loses its legitimacy when the American people don’t believe that judges will be ethical and fair-minded. It's time to make sure our federal judges are held to the highest ethical standards. And I've got a plan for that:
"Equal justice under law.
We believe it, now it's time to act on it.
That’s why I’ve got a plan to hold our judges to the highest ethical standards."
We need accountability. That should start with Congress and the appropriate state authorities opening investigations and conducting hearings to make Facebook executives explain the company’s policies and practices—under oath.
"In fact, this time they’re going further by taking deliberate steps to help one candidate intentionally mislead the American people, while painting the candidacy of others (specifically: mine) as an ""existential” threat. This is a serious concern for our democratic process."
"There’s no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played in that successful attack, nor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election."
"Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy—allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections."
They’re allowing Trump to spend over $1 million a week right now for ads on their platform—including ones that air the same lies that TV stations won’t. Here’s an example of an ad that Facebook let Trump run despite being obviously untrue:
"After that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on “misinformation” in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers. Put another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies."
"For instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about?"
"Pregnancy discrimination in the workplace is illegal—sadly it’s still alarmingly common, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways."

Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an “existential” threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.
The daily toll of gun violence in communities across the country is overwhelming. I’m heartsick for the victims and their families. We need action to end gun violence—now.
"China is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles—and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights."
It shouldn't take a federal judge to force a candidate to disclose their tax returns. My plan to end corruption would require any candidate for federal office to disclose their tax returns.
"For decades, the wealthy and the well-connected have put the American government to work for them. It's time to make sure everyone else has a chance to succeed. We need a #TwoCentWealthTax—and more."
"I support bringing our troops home from Syria. But President Trump's reckless and unplanned withdrawal undermines both our partners and our security. We need a strategy to end this conflict, not a president who can be swayed by one phone call."
"These changes will allow us to hold bad actors accountable, and begin to restore accountability and trust in a fair, impartial federal judiciary."
"We'll ensure that Supreme Court justices follow a code of ethics, too. That means that a judge accused of lying to Congress, like Brett Kavanaugh, could face a full judicial investigation. And they couldn't end that investigation by being elevated to the Supreme Court."
"It’s time for fundamental reform. My plan will ensure that federal judges do not hear cases where they have conflicts of interest, strengthen our nation’s ethics rules for judges, and ensure accountability for those who violate these rules."
"And when judges have come under investigation, they can simply resign to avoid accountability. That's how Donald Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ended an investigation into the Trump family’s potential tax fraud and other tax schemes."
"Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia did not recuse themselves from Citizens United v. FEC, the case that opened an avalanche of money in politics to the benefit of people like the Koch brothers, who invited the pair on multiple all-expenses paid retreats."
"A basic principle of our federal judicial system is that judges make decisions as disinterested, impartial observers. Yet several judges have ruled on cases while owning stock in companies arguing before them."
Our legal system loses its legitimacy when the American people don’t believe that judges will be ethical and fair-minded. I have a plan to strengthen the integrity and impartiality of the federal judiciary.
We continue to break records as our planet gets hotter and hotter. We need urgent action now to end the climate crisis.
It’s disgusting that the Trump administration is arguing in favor of discrimination. We need an administration that will fight to protect LGBTQ+ rights.
"Americans will lose trust in our judicial system if they no longer believe that our judges will be held to the highest ethical standards. 

Like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached. #ReclaimTheCourt"
We cannot have a truly democratic society with so little power in the hands of working people. We cannot have sustained and inclusive economic growth without a stronger labor movement.
"I'm heartsick for Joshua Brown's family and friends. He bravely stepped forward and testified to bring some justice for Botham Jean, and peace for his family. We need answers—and Joshua Brown and his family need justice."
"I’m with you all the way! My plan to return power to working people will expand the right to unionize to even more workers. When unions win, all workers win. #UnionsForAll"

Here’s my promise to America’s public school teachers—I’ll appoint a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher.
I will protect and expand workers' rights. That starts with appointing a dedicated advocate for workers to any Supreme Court vacancy.
"Glad I had the opportunity to talk about my two-cent wealth tax in San Diego earlier this week. It's two cents per dollar after the first $50 million, and with it, we can pay for #UniversalChildCare, make public college free for all, and much more."
"Thank you for taking the time to talk with me yesterday, @ChirlaFund. In a Warren administration, immigrants and refugees will be treated with dignity and respect. I’m in this fight with you all the way."
This campaign is an adventure—and I couldn't do it without Bruce by my side.
"The US-India partnership has always been rooted in our shared democratic values. I'm concerned about recent events in Kashmir, including a continued communications blackout and other restrictions. The rights of the people of Kashmir must be respected."
"So good to join @SEIU today to talk about how we can return power to working people by protecting and strengthening unions. Together, we’re going to make big, structural change!"
"If Facebook finds my scrutiny uncomfortable, here's what Mark Zuckerberg and his team could work on:
—Ending his company's illegal anticompetitive practices
—Protecting consumers' privacy instead of Facebook's profits
—Ensuring Facebook isn’t undermining our election security"
"Thank you so much for coming to our Washington Square Park event, Cath! Stay strong out there—we’re gonna win this fight together."
"Kroger is laying off hundreds of workers—after spending billions on stock buybacks. Union workers are fighting for Kroger's success, but who in Kroger is fighting for workers? I've got a plan to return power to working people."
"We have to end the widespread practice of misclassifying workers as independent contractors—and in the meantime, my administration will protect the right of gig workers to form unions."
"If 100 people died today from a mysterious virus, we would be all over it.

Gun violence is a public health emergency. Let's treat it that way."
"Unions built America’s middle class, and unions will rebuild America’s middle class. And when I am president, unions will have an ally in the White House."
"I’m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in to help raise $24.6 million in the third fundraising quarter. Together, we’re building a movement that’s going to put power back in the hands of the people."
Extremist Republican lawmakers are hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play to cut off access to abortion. It's time to stop playing defense. I've got a plan to protect reproductive care—no matter what the Supreme Court does.
The president is abusing our diplomatic relationships to demand foreign interference in our elections. Donald Trump must be impeached.
"Thank you for the warm welcome, San Diego! Together, we’re going to build a grassroots movement to fight for big, structural change."
I love this! Stay strong out there—and find joy where you can. I’m with you in this fight all the way.
"When I first ran for the Senate, they told me that a woman couldn't win. But we built a movement, made history, and won. And I'm ready to do it again to fight for the big, structural change that we need."
"Congratulations! When unions win, all workers win."
"Our government is working great for the gun industry—but not for families suffering because of gun violence. If we want to end this crisis, we have to tackle the corruption in Washington."

"Trump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors.

The public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values."

"Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many citizens they can keep from the polls. Under my plan to protect our democracy, there will be no more arbitrary voter purges. Ohio voters: Check your registration."
It's always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston (go Cougars!). We need to cancel student debt and make college free for everyone who wants it.
"UAW workers fought for GM. But who in GM management will fight for their workers? 

I've got a plan to return power to working people—and that starts with requiring large companies like GM to allow workers to elect board members."
Returning power to working people will be the overarching goal of my presidency. My administration will protect and expand workers' rights—and I pledge as president to nominate a demonstrated advocate for workers to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.
Donald Trump is now openly calling for foreign governments to interfere in our elections from the White House Lawn. If he thinks openly committing the same crime will convince people his secret calls weren’t illegal—he's wrong. We will hold him accountable. He must be impeached.
"We're fighting so that our children can grow up in a better world. My job is to be strong for them—and they make me stronger, too."
"Too many immigrants have died in ICE custody. We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system."
"Together, these changes will boost America’s labor movement, help create an economy that works for everyone, and put power back in the hands of working people."
I will also remake the federal courts with nominees who support working people. That starts at the top: I pledge as president to nominate a demonstrated advocate for workers to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.
"Every worker should be treated with dignity and respect, and be safe in their place of employment. Any employer that fails to do so should be held accountable. My administration will expand worker protections, combat discrimination, and improve enforcement against violations."
"Over the past few decades, workers have been left with fewer employment choices and less control over the companies that employ them. I'll reverse that trend by increasing worker choice and control, including requiring large companies to let workers elect board members."
"My administration will raise wages for workers and protect the hard-earned pensions and retirement savings of working people. We'll start by raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers, including tipped workers and workers with disabilities."
"Next, we'll strengthen organizing rights, make it easier for unions to assert their rights, and we’ll expand the right to strike. Unions built America’s middle class, and they will rebuild the middle class."
"My agenda to return power to working people starts with extending labor rights to all workers—including workers who have been misclassified as ""independent contractors."" We’ll also extend basic protections to farm workers and domestic workers, including the right to organize."
We can't have a truly democratic society with so little power in the hands of working people—and we can't have sustained and inclusive economic growth without a stronger labor movement. That’s why returning power to working people will be the overarching goal of my presidency.
"Giant corporations and their allies in Washington and state governments have spent decades systematically attacking unions. As more power has shifted into the hands of Wall Street managers and CEOs, it’s taken trillions of dollars out of the pockets of working families."
"Even as corporate profits have soared, working families are hanging on by their fingernails. I've got a plan for the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal."
"This is a moment for American leadership. The country needs a president capable of both advancing U.S. economic interests and standing up for America’s values, not one who sees the two as in conflict with one another."

Corporate interests spent $2.8 billion on lobbying just last year. We have to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Washington. That's why I'm proposing a new tax on excessive lobbying.
"If my plan to tax excessive lobbying had been in place during that time, Facebook would've paid $39 million in taxes—money that could've been directed to the FTC's antitrust efforts. We have to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Washington."
Facebook recently ramped up their lobbying spending as they faced greater antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.
"Over the past decade, Facebook has spent more than $64 million lobbying our government against policies that protect consumer privacy and election integrity."
"If we want to make the big, structural change we need to break the grip of the NRA on Washington, we'll need a movement fighting for change on the outside, and a leader willing to act. I stand proudly with @GiffordsCourage and @AMarch4OurLives. #2020Safety"

Grateful for the opportunity to talk with @CecileRichards and @AijenPoo on @Supermajority’s organizing tour today. #TheMajorityRules and together we will fight hard to protect and expand women’s reproductive health care and rights.
I’m looking forward to seeing my friend @BernieSanders strong and back on the campaign trail soon.
We need a president and an administration that will fight for small family farmers—not tell them to throw in the towel. I've got a plan to level the playing field for America's family farmers.
"It's time to break the NRA's stranglehold on Congress and end Washington corruption. 

And I've got a plan for that."
"To make big, structural change, we're going to need a movement working for change from the outside and a leader willing to act. I applaud the work of these activists—and when I'm president, we'll ban private prisons."
"Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon."
"We can end excessive lobbying. This is the kind of big, structural change we need to put power back in the hands of the people and end corruption in Washington."
"Nobody will be surprised that the top five industries that would've paid the most are those that have spent the last decade fighting tooth and nail against popular policies: Big Pharma, health insurance companies, oil and gas companies, Wall Street firms, and electric utilities."
Every dollar raised will be placed into a new Lobbying Defense Trust Fund dedicated to directing a surge of resources to Congress and federal agencies to fight back against these lobbying onslaughts when they occur.
"My tax on excessive lobbying would apply to every corporation and trade group that spends over $500,000 a year lobbying our government. If this tax had been in effect over the last 10 years, over 1,600 corporations and trade groups would've paid an estimated $10 billion in taxes."
"Corporate lobbyists swarm Congress and our federal departments to weaken, delay, or kill efforts to implement laws they don't like. They spent more than $2.8 billion on lobbying last year alone."
Corporate interests spent $2.8 billion on lobbying just last year. We have to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Washington. That's why I'm proposing a new tax on excessive lobbying.
"If my plan to tax excessive lobbying had been in place during that time, Facebook would've paid $39 million in taxes—money that could've been directed to the FTC's antitrust efforts. We have to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Washington."
Facebook recently ramped up their lobbying spending as they faced greater antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.
"Over the past decade, Facebook has spent more than $64 million lobbying our government against policies that protect consumer privacy and election integrity."
"If we want to make the big, structural change we need to break the grip of the NRA on Washington, we'll need a movement fighting for change on the outside, and a leader willing to act. I stand proudly with @GiffordsCourage and @AMarch4OurLives. #2020Safety"
"Thank you @GabbyGiffords for your persistence and your advocacy. I’ll fight alongside you for the big, structural change we need to end gun violence. #2020GunSafety"
"I believe Washington should work for you—not billionaires or Wall Street. I'm Elizabeth Warren, and I approve this message."
"Thank you, Jennifer, for working with me to help pass the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act. We need to make sure hearing assistance devices are available for anyone who needs one."
"Thank you for having me, @Supermajority! In a Warren administration, we will reverse the Title X gag rule and #RepealHyde. Together, we can make our democracy work for us again. #TheMajorityRules"
Grateful for the opportunity to talk with @CecileRichards and @AijenPoo on @Supermajority’s organizing tour today. #TheMajorityRules and together we will fight hard to protect and expand women’s reproductive health care and rights.
I’m looking forward to seeing my friend @BernieSanders strong and back on the campaign trail soon.
We need a president and an administration that will fight for small family farmers—not tell them to throw in the towel. I've got a plan to level the playing field for America's family farmers.
"It's time to break the NRA's stranglehold on Congress and end Washington corruption. 

And I've got a plan for that."
"To make big, structural change, we're going to need a movement working for change from the outside and a leader willing to act. I applaud the work of these activists—and when I'm president, we'll ban private prisons."

We have to break the grip that lobbyists have on our government for good. My plan to end Washington corruption calls for something unique—a new tax on excessive lobbying.
"When you find a good one, grab them and hang on."
"Thank you, @jvn, for such kind words! Proud to have you with me in this fight."
Americans don't trust their government precisely because of this. My plan to end Washington corruption would ban members of Congress from serving on corporate boards and owning or trading individual stocks. No exceptions.
"Facebook's anti-competitive mergers mean they face no real pressure to tackle disinformation. They won't even do the bare minimum to improve transparency.

Tech giants shouldn't be able to wield enough power to undermine our democracy."
"Thank you, Nyle! We’re fighting for a better America for everyone—no exceptions."
"So many incredible LGBTQ+ Americans have fought for big, structural change so that everyone could #DreamBigLiveProud—and I’m honored to keep up the fight."
"I won't let giant corporations dictate our trade policy anymore. I'll use America's leverage to support working families, protect the environment, and raise the standard of living across the globe."
"Saddened to learn of the passing of Enrique Fernández-Toledo. He was a champion for Puerto Rico, especially in the island’s time of need. I greatly valued his insights and advocacy, and my heart goes out to his family and friends."
"Imagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security. That's why we need to #BreakUpBigTech."
"My plan to #BreakUpBigTech would undo their illegal, anticompetitive mergers. You'll still be able to use Facebook and Instagram to catch up with friends and family and share photos of your dog. But they'll have to compete with each other to make a better product for you."
"Zuckerberg himself said Facebook is “more like a government than a traditional company.” They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else."
Facebook is doing pretty well right now. They've acquired potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram. More than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook. They've got a lot of power—and face little competition or accountability.
Let's talk a bit about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech and why it's got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.
"Thank you so much for teaching me, Kirsten, and for all of your hard work! We’re in this fight together."
"We have to fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. #BreakUpBigTech"
"I loved being a teacher—and I’m humbled to see some of my former students joining the fight for big, structural change!"
"Washington, D.C. has over 700,000 residents—more than Wyoming or Vermont. They pay federal taxes. They deserve an equal voice in our government, and I'll fight until they get statehood."
My heart goes out to the families and friends of those we lost during the #Route91 shooting two years ago today. I'll keep fighting to end gun violence in America.
"I'm not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech:"

"Loved talking with Collyn from Dorchester, Massachusetts! Collyn chipped in $25.75 to our grassroots campaign, so I called to say thank you. We both agreed: It’s time to make our government work for all of us."
"A year has passed, but Donald Trump and his administration have done nothing to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. He and his family deserve justice."
Donald Trump is committing crimes from the Oval Office. He must be impeached—and every single person involved must be held accountable.
"Again, Donald Trump abused the United States' diplomatic channels for his own personal political gain. And again, he attempted to hide his actions."
"It was great talking with you, Collyn."
"I just called Maria from Concord, New Hampshire, to thank her for the $25 donation she made today. Together, we’re going to dream big and fight hard. Thank you, Maria!"
"Yes, Cree, it was really me! Cree is an HIV Prevention Coordinator from Minnesota. They pitched in to our campaign today, so I called them to say thanks. We’re in this together, Cree."
"I talked with another Bailey—this time Bailey from Iowa. She chipped in $3 earlier today, so I called her to tell her how grateful I am.

Two Baileys and an Elizabeth—surely we can get this done! Chip in now, and I could call you next."
I'm starting my grassroots call time now—have you donated yet? I might give you a call to say thanks!
"Today’s the last day to donate before our big FEC deadline. I’ll be calling grassroots donors again tonight—be sure to chip in if you want to talk with me about the big, structural change we’re making together."
"Thank you so much @UFCW for inviting me to speak with you. When unions win, all workers win. Together, we’ll fight for a country that works for all of us—not just the giant corporations."
I've lived in an America where abortions were illegal. Women still got abortions—but they were dangerous and too often deadly. The Hyde Amendment harms the most vulnerable women by limiting their ability to safely access abortion. It's time for Hyde to go.
"Shana Tovah to all those who are celebrating Rosh Hashanah! Bruce and I wish you a sweet, happy, healthy new year."
"Our campaign is grassroots funded: That means no fancy fundraisers, no PACs, no federal lobbyists.

Our big quarterly FEC deadline is tonight. Will you chip in $3 before midnight to help power our grassroots campaign?"
"This is what call time means to me: Talking with grassroots donors who give whatever they can to build this movement. I'm making more calls tomorrow. Chip in $3 or whatever you can, and I might just call you to say thanks!"
"It's going to take big, structural change to tackle poverty and inequality in the U.S., and @AOC's ""A Just Society"" is just the type of bold, comprehensive thinking we'll need to get it done."
"On this #GoldStarMothersDay, Bruce and I are thinking of Gold Star moms everywhere. Our hearts go out to you, and we are grateful for your strength and resolve."
"I’m so sorry I missed you, Alaina! Thank you so much for chipping in to our campaign. Stay strong out there!"

We've got to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Congress—and I've got a plan for that.
"Every time I talk to a grassroots donor, I feel fired up about the big, structural change we can build together. I’m calling more people today—chip in $3 if you want to chat."
I've been a public school teacher. And I'm committed to having a Secretary of Education who has also been a public school teacher.
"Right now, we've got an economy that's working great for those at the top, but not so great for everyone else. We need big structural change to make sure everyone has an opportunity to succeed—starting with a two-cent wealth tax."
"GM made billions of dollars in profits, but closed multiple plants in the United States. GM has no loyalty to the workers of America or the people of America. @UAW workers are fighting back—and I'm proud to march alongside them."
"Our big FEC fundraising deadline is tomorrow, but you won’t find me jetting from city to city scooping up big checks from wealthy donors and special interests.

This campaign is powered by grassroots donors. Will you chip in $3 now?"
"I’m grateful for Lucas from Arizona, who chipped in $10 to our grassroots campaign. We talked about the importance of building a grassroots movement to hold our government accountable. Thanks, Lucas!"
"I talked with Maura, a lawyer from NYC, earlier today. She chipped in $3 to this fight for big, structural change. Thank you, Maura!"
"Thank you for the warm welcome, South Carolina! Bruce and I had a fantastic time at @Clinton1894.

Together, we're going to make the big, structural change we need to build an economy and a government that works for all of us—not just the wealthy and well-connected!"
Terrific meal—and a group photo!
"I’m deeply grateful for the grassroots movement we’re building together. But we need the resources to keep @TeamWarren growing.

Will you chip in $3 before our FEC fundraising deadline so we’ll have what it takes to win in 2020?"
"Jahnavi from Arizona chipped in $10, so I called from the car to say thanks! This is how we’re going to do it, building a grassroots movement all across the country."
Woo-hoo!
We must break the NRA’s stranglehold on our government. I've got a plan to pass sweeping anti-corruption legislation so that our nation will no longer be held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists.
Bruce and I love to hike. We’ve been from Utah to Alaska to the Cape Cod National Seashore. Public lands are some of our greatest treasures—and we must protect them. Let’s recommit to preserving and enhancing them. I’ve got a plan for that.   #PublicLandsDay

Who will I talk to next?"
Not ridiculous at all! Glad we got to chat.
"You bet. Grassroots call time is when I get to talk with voters and listen to what gets them into this fight. We’re going to do this together!

Chip in next, and I could call you soon:"
"Here’s the deal: I’ll be calling grassroots donors again today to thank them for chipping into our campaign.

Will you chip in whatever you can now? If you get a call from an unknown number, it might just be me."
"Then we have to go even further to correct historical injustices and ensure that everyone has an opportunity at a higher education. I've got a plan to create a minimum $50 billion fund for HBCUs, TCUs, and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs)."
"If the Senate doesn't pass the FUTURE Act by Monday, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges and universities, and other Minority Serving Institutions will lose $255 million of funding. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill—now."
We should stand with the protesters in Egypt fighting for a better future—and we must be clear that violence and repression are unacceptable responses to those who seek to express their opinion or affect political change.
"I had a great time in Hollis, New Hampshire today! We're going to dream big, fight hard, and win together."
"I still believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. And like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached."
The NRA is a corrupt group of well-financed extremists who have made it perfectly clear that they will never put the safety of the American people first. We must hold them accountable.
"Fallon, I'm so excited for you! Thank you for keeping our pinkie-promise and running for school president. That *is* what girls do!"
"Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in living memory.

I believe we can win the White House, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020—but only if we all work together.

Will you donate before our FEC deadline?"
"That is, in fact, exactly what the CFPB is supposed to do."
"Refugees are fleeing violence and oppression, and our values compel us to help them. As president, I'll reverse Trump's cruel, bigoted policies and welcome at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term."
"After the past two CEOs failed, Mr. Scharf has a lot of work to do to clean up Wells Fargo and to ensure that all of the people hurt by the bank's past scams get every penny of relief they're owed. I'll be watching him carefully."
"I’m sorry I missed you, Kerry! Thank you for the work you do every day as an educator—and don’t worry, those first-year teacher jitters will go away soon."
I love going on the road and meeting all our supporters! I especially love when I get to do it with Bruce by my side.
"Molly from Maryland chipped in $15—thank you for making a difference! Together, we can rein in Wall Street corruption and make our economy work for working people."
"Glad I got to talk with Athena, a photographer from Minnesota! Athena pitched in to our campaign for the first time—donate now, and you might get a call from me soon, too!"
I'm sorry I missed you. But I'm glad you got some sleep! We're going to need you well-rested and ready for this fight.

"It was great talking to grassroots donors last night. I’ll be calling more supporters who donate today.

Chip in now before our FEC fundraising deadline, and you could be next!"

"Time and time again, widely popular policies are narrowed or blocked by powerful interests capable of providing resources and information to a vastly under-resourced Congress. These steps will help break our government from the grip of lobbyists and help it work for all of us."
"My plan revives and modernizes the Office of Technology Assessment, shores up congressional support agencies, and transitions congressional staff to competitive salaries—so we can have competent public policy that actually holds big corporations accountable."
I've got a plan to end lobbying as we know it—but strengthening Congress’ independence requires us to do more. We must invest in resources to allow members of Congress to make informed decisions without relying on self-interested outside sources.
"And when Congress votes on restoring net neutrality protections, our representatives shouldn’t have to turn to internet service providers to explain whether their industry needs more regulation."
"When Congress decides whether it should break up big tech companies, our representatives shouldn’t have to rely on Google’s policy team to understand the effects of technology consolidation."
"When Congress debates the #GreenNewDeal, our representatives shouldn’t have to rely on Exxon lobbyists to explain who should pay for the effects of carbon emissions on our planet."
"I saw firsthand how this system works when I was fighting for the CFPB. Financial reform is complicated, and bank lobbyists bombarded Congress with complex arguments and obscure terms. It's the ultimate insiders’ play: ""Trust us because we understand it and you don’t."""
"Over the last 20 years, lobbyist spending has skyrocketed. At the same time, Congress has been starved of resources to objectively analyze complex public policy issues, leaving corporate lobbyist propaganda to fill the gap. I've got a plan to fix that:"
"Now that call time is done, it's Bailey's turn to have some fun!"
"Thank you for standing up and speaking out, @AmberKGoodwin. I’ll be fighting alongside you until we #EndGunViolence."
This is a disgrace. Eugene Scalia spent his career putting the interests of giant corporations ahead of American workers. I stand ready to fight back to protect worker's rights.
Giant corporations shouldn't be able to toy with their workers' health care benefits. We need #MedicareForAll.
"Grateful down to my toes for everyone who chipped in today. No matter how much you’re able to give, you own a piece of our movement.

I’ll be calling more grassroots donors every day from now until Monday—chip in and you could be next!"
"So glad I was able to catch Jeff, a Fire Chief from Alaska, to thank him for chipping in to our grassroots campaign. We’re in this fight together, Jeff!"
"Feeling inspired down to my toes after talking with Emily. She chipped in $15 because she’s determined we can win in 2020 and make big, structural change—including tackling our country’s opioid epidemic head on. Thank you, Emily."
"Bailee from Texas chipped in $5 to our campaign, so me and my Bailey left a voicemail to say thank you."
"Krishan says he believes in me, and I believe in him!

We talked about taking back the Senate in 2020 and getting rid of the filibuster. We're going to do this together, Krishan. Thanks for chipping in."
"I’m heading to New Hampshire this afternoon, but before I go I wanted to call more grassroots donors to thank them for chipping into our campaign.

"Double woo-hoo thank you to Zachary from Ohio who donated $3 today! Zachary said he can’t afford to give a lot, but let me tell you Zach, your $3 make a difference. We can win in 2020, and it’s because of grassroots donors like you."

"I’m about to call grassroots donors who chipped in to our campaign today. Whether you can pitch in $1 here or $15 there, we all own a piece of this movement."
"This is deeply disturbing and illustrates just how urgently we need Congress to address this issue. Andrea, thank you for your bravery—I’ll fight alongside you to end sexual harassment in VA centers."
"I'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need."
You know a system is deeply broken when people have to quit their jobs to afford health care. It’s time for #MedicareForAll.
"Congratulations! When unions win, all workers win."
"There's only one way we're raising money on this campaign, and it's with grassroots donors like you.

Will you chip in right now to help hit our goal before the FEC deadline? $3 or whatever you can give will make a real difference."
"Thank you, Keene, New Hampshire! We're going to make big, structural change together."
"Donald Trump is just the worst symptom of a corrupt system. The problems in Washington are much bigger than him—and it's going to take big, structural change to fundamentally transform our government. I've got a plan to root out corruption in Washington."
"Donald Trump believes he is above the law—and he will continue to commit crimes from the White House until we hold him accountable. The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires."

"No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. It’s Congress' constitutional responsibility to hold Trump accountable—and the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands."
"Insurance companies make a profit by denying necessary health care for millions of people. It's not right—and it's why I'm fighting for #MedicareForAll. Thank you for being a part of this fight, @jvn, and for your courage to speak your truth. We're going to do this together."

No child should go to school hungry. The Trump administration's move to cancel free school lunches for hundreds of thousands of children is just cruel.
Women held at Karnes Detention Center are receiving inadequate medical care—and now ICE wants to transfer them in order to detain more families. This cruelty must end. We must stop unnecessary detention and welcome those seeking asylum.
Good luck! Fight hard.
"The president admitted it.

The ""transcript"" confirms it.

Donald Trump continues to commit crimes from the Oval Office, and the Justice Department refuses to hold him accountable. Now it’s on Congress to act. No one is above the law—not even the president."
"Corvias has failed to maintain the military homes they were entrusted with. 

Why should they be entrusted with providing a hotel for @csunorthridge, especially while students face an affordable housing crisis?"
Johana Medina Leon and Layleen Cubilette-Polanco should be alive right now. We must enforce strict standards for medical care for LGBTQ+ people in custody. We must end cash bail. We must end the unnecessary detainment of asylum seekers. #SayTheirNames
"This ""transcript"" itself is a smoking gun. If this is the version of events the president's team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy. We need to see the full whistleblower complaint and the administration needs to follow the law. Now."
"As soon as I left the @UAW picket line, I called Cynthia to let her know that I have her back. We're in this fight together."
No child should be denied a loving home because of bigotry and discrimination. LGBTQ+ couples who want to open their hearts and their homes deserve our support—and I'll continue to stand with them.

It shouldn't be. We got into this crisis because states and the federal government have passed the cost of higher education onto students and their families. We need universal free public college—and we need to cancel student loan debt.
The daily toll of gun violence is staggering. We need to pass comprehensive gun violence legislation—and we need to tackle the corruption that has held up any attempts to end this epidemic.
"I loved going to our @TeamWarren house party in Mount Vernon yesterday and listening to what gets people in this fight. As president, I promise to fight for the big, structural changes that Iowa and the country needs."
Stopped by Hamburg Inn in Iowa City for a strawberry rhubarb pie milkshake yesterday. Delicious!
"America has a housing crisis—and working families are feeling it hard. Yesterday at Golfview Mobile Home Court, I talked with the people of North Liberty about how we can level the playing field for all families. My housing plan makes it possible:"
Chicago’s nurses fight their hearts out for their patients. They deserve to be treated with respect—and that means adequate staffing levels. I will always stand and fight alongside our nurses. #RNstrike #1u
"You inspire me, @GretaThunberg. Activists have always been the driving force behind big, structural change—and yesterday’s powerful #ClimateStrike proved that together, we have a fighting chance at ending our climate crisis. 

Where you lead, I’ll follow."
"Today at the @PolkDems Iowa #SteakFry, I said what I’ve been saying since April: It’s time for us to call out Donald Trump’s illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings—now."
Thank you @PolkDems for the opportunity to participate in a terrific Democratic tradition. I promise to keep dreaming big and fighting hard alongside the people of Iowa. #SteakFry
Grateful to have a friend stop by our #SteakFry photo line.
Volunteers all the way! Our volunteers are the backbone of my campaign. Send a message to @TeamWarren to get involved.

Our laws don't consistently protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It's past time to change that—starting by passing the Equality Act.
Eighteen Black trans women have been killed so far this year. It’s time for a president of the United States of America to #SayTheirNames. #LGBTQForum

"You inspire me, @GretaThunberg. Activists have always been the driving force behind big, structural change—and yesterday’s powerful #ClimateStrike proved that together, we have a fighting chance at ending our climate crisis. 

Where you lead, I’ll follow."
"Today at the @PolkDems Iowa #SteakFry, I said what I’ve been saying since April: It’s time for us to call out Donald Trump’s illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings—now."
Thank you @PolkDems for the opportunity to participate in a terrific Democratic tradition. I promise to keep dreaming big and fighting hard alongside the people of Iowa. #SteakFry
Grateful to have a friend stop by our #SteakFry photo line.
Volunteers all the way! Our volunteers are the backbone of my campaign. Send a message to @TeamWarren to get involved.
"I’m inspired by everyone who made their voices heard during yesterday’s #ClimateStrike—and I was grateful to meet some of them at the Blue Strawberry Coffee Shop in Cedar Rapids yesterday.

Together, we can tackle climate change head-on, and I have a #PlanForThat."
"Unions built the middle class, and unions will rebuild the middle class. Looking forward to joining @UAW's picket line tomorrow. I hope you'll join us:   #UAWStrike #1u"
"I was grateful to meet you, Angelica. You and Ashlee remind me why I’m in this fight."
"Grateful for the opportunity to be part of @GLAAD’s #LGBTQForum. In a Warren administration, LGBTQ+ people will be able to be who they are without fear of violence or discrimination."
Our laws don't consistently protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It's past time to change that—starting by passing the Equality Act.
Eighteen Black trans women have been killed so far this year. It’s time for a president of the United States of America to #SayTheirNames. #LGBTQForum
"Eighteen Black trans women have been killed this year. This is an epidemic, and we need to call it out. #LGBTQForum"
I’ll be live soon at the #LGBTQForum! Tune in:
"Eight years ago, President Obama repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell. It was an important step towards protecting #LGBTQ service members' rights. But Trump's ban on trans service members has set us back again. When I'm president, I'll reverse this ban and protect LGBTQ service members."
Trans women who experience homelessness are already disproportionately more likely to face violence. If Secretary Carson is not willing to do his job and protect all Americans experiencing housing insecurity then he shouldn't have his job.
Secretary Carson's transphobic remarks are completely unacceptable.
"In 1974, Democrats and Republicans united in support of impeachment not out of mutual contempt for Nixon but mutual respect for the rule of law. Congress refused to be complicit in future law-breaking by Nixon or other presidents. It’s time for this Congress to step up and act."
"Mitch McConnell is also complicit. The Senate must vote on the bill, already passed by the House, to help states and localities protect themselves from the foreign attacks on our elections that the President has previously welcomed."
"A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won’t either. Today’s news confirmed he thinks he’s above the law. If we do nothing, he’ll be right."
"After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president."
"Trump's “metering” and ""Remain in Mexico"" policies are putting immigrant families at risk. I will end these cruel policies and ensure asylum seekers are welcomed."
"Ha, I do! I hope your meeting went well and your plans are ready to go."
"Thank you, @JayInslee. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to stop the climate crisis—and that starts with eliminating the filibuster so that we can make the big, structural change we desperately need to save our planet."
"Take any big problem that we face in America today, and you don't have to dig deep to see corruption at work, holding up progress and putting us at risk. I know what's broken—and I've got a plan to fix it. That's why I'm running for president of the United States."
"Today, my heart is with the people of Puerto Rico as we continue to mourn the lives lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria two years ago. The federal government failed our fellow citizens—and you bet I’m fighting with everything I've got to ensure that never happens again."
Thank you @BilldeBlasio for making working families the center of your campaign. This is our moment to fight for an America that works for all of us—not just the people at the top. Let's keep fighting.
"I'm ready to fight, and I've got big plans to meet the goals of the #GreenNewDeal and achieve 100% clean energy for America."
"Climate change is an existential threat—and we are already facing the effects. The youth-led #ClimateStrike and the solidarity strikes from groups like @AMZNforClimate show that our country is ready to fight for the big, structural change we'll need to tackle the climate crisis."
"Climate change is an existential threat, and we are running out of time—but I have hope. I have hope thanks to the young people participating in the #ClimateStrike. I have hope thanks to the people I meet who are committed to making big, structural change to save our planet."
"A terrific sunset, and a terrific crowd here in Iowa City tonight."
"So grateful to have had @MauriceWFP with me at our Washington Square Park event. @WorkingFamilies has been on the front line of the fight for racial and economic justice, and I'm honored to have their support. We're going to build this grassroots movement together."
"Last night, I called up grassroots donors who chipped in to my campaign to say thanks—and you could be next.

Will you chip in now, too? Even $3 makes a big difference, especially with our FEC fundraising deadline right around the corner."

"I want every little girl to grow up knowing that when they fight from the heart, they can win. And we pinky promise so they won’t forget."
"Our economy works great for people who can use their money and power to become even richer and more powerful. But I've got a plan to ensure it works for everyone else too. If that scares hedge fund billionaires like this guy, fine by me."
"The Trump administration is trying to stack the deck against asylum applicants. That's not right—our laws and values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. When I'm president, I'll undo his dangerous policies and welcome asylum seekers."
"Border Patrol agents are not asylum officers. They shouldn't get to determine who meets the ""credible fear"" standard for asylum. Seeking asylum is not a crime, and we shouldn’t be treating refugees this way."
"Sorry I missed you, LaVel! Grateful down to my toes to have you in this fight."
"Thank you, Eve—I’m so sorry I missed you! I know that together, we can take the power from the NRA and the lawmakers in their pockets and return it to the people."
"Thank you, Erin—grateful down to my toes to have your support!"
"My heart goes out to @WhipClyburn and his family after the loss of his wife, Emily. An activist and librarian who raised tens of thousands of dollars to help students attend college, she was a fixture in her community, and she will be deeply missed."
"Bridgette’s story highlights so many problems with our criminal justice system—from how it fails to protect survivors of domestic violence, to the injustice of mandatory minimums, to the lack of rehabilitative services. I've got a comprehensive plan for reform."
It's time to get rid of the Electoral College.
Today's historic hearing in the House of Representatives is an important step towards #DCStatehood. Washington D.C. residents deserve an equal voice in our government—they deserve statehood now.
Thank you to everyone who passed me a note in the selfie line in New York City—they mean the world to me.
"Today is National HIV/AIDS and Aging Awareness Day. Thanks to improvements in treatments, those with HIV can live longer, fuller lives. We need #MedicareForAll to ensure that everyone who needs treatment gets it. #HIVAndAging"
It's time for @StationCasinos management to sit down and negotiate a fair contract with @Culinary226 workers.
"If we're going to make big, structural change, we're going to need someone leading from the inside—but we'll also need a grassroots movement pushing from the outside. The selfie line gives me a moment (or a few thousand moments) to meet that movement."
I'm so excited by all of the new voices that have joined #TeamWarren—especially @rgay. Her work has changed the way we think about this moment in history and how we're preparing for the fight ahead of us. Thank you for your support.
"My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would end lobbying as we know it. Under that plan, it would be illegal for former members of congress like Pat Meehan to get jobs as lobbyists once they leave office."
Check out the new and improved plans section of my website!
Congratulations to #TeamWarren’s own @CAMONGHNE for making the 2019 @nationalbook Awards longlist for her poetry! I’m honored to have you on my team.

"I hope today's procedure goes well and that we have many more years with you, Ady. You're absolutely right—everyone should have the long-term care that they need. That’s why we’re fighting for #MedicareForAll."
No company should be able to withhold health care benefits as leverage against striking workers. We need #MedicareForAll.
"We have to know that when government officials are making decisions, they are considering only the public interest—not their own personal interests or the interests of their friends and future employers. I'll close and padlock this revolving door."
No health care system should have billions in reserve while raising rates and outsourcing jobs—but that’s exactly what Kaiser is doing. I stand with the @KPThrive workers getting ready to strike for a health care system that works for all. #KeepThriveAlive #KPStrikeSupporter
"Our reproductive rights are under attack. But I’m tired of being on defense—I’m ready to go on offense. With supporters and organizers like @NARAL, I believe that we can protect and expand our reproductive rights."
"It was a marathon, but we made it! See you tonight at 9pm ET, @maddow."
I've got a plan to protect reproductive care from right-wing ideologues in every state and ensure real access to birth control and abortion care for all. I'll make sure our reproductive rights are protected no matter what the Supreme Court does.
"Looking forward to seeing you tonight, @StephenAtHome!"
"How can small companies have any chance if Amazon manipulates their algorithm to boost their own products and profits? 

You can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both in the same game. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech."
"As we celebrate the official adoption of our Constitution, we also remember that from voting to reproductive health care to freedom from discrimination, our constitutional rights are under attack. I’ve got a plan to defend and protect these rights. #ConstitutionDay"
"Corruption killed over 100 women in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. But in the aftermath of that tragedy, women workers organized, fought back, and secured major victories. I know big, structural change is possible—because America's done it before."
"Thanks for sticking around until the end, Matt! Selfies and big, structural change—two promises I’ll keep."
"The energy of our grassroots supporters keeps me going. This is our moment in history to dream big, fight hard, and win. #WarrenNYC"
The wealthy and well-connected haven't just scooped up a huge chunk of the wealth all of us have worked hard to produce—they’ve also gobbled up opportunity itself. But this is America. We should invest in opportunities for everyone. #WarrenNYC
"Throughout our history, Americans have been told that it wasn’t possible to make big, structural change. But they didn’t give up. They built grassroots movements—and they changed the course of American history. I believe we can do it again. Thank you, New York. #WarrenNYC"

We'll fix our criminal laws to make sure we can hold corrupt officials accountable. And we'll ensure that our federal agencies and courts work for the people. That includes holding our federal judiciary—including the Supreme Court—to the highest ethical standards.
"We'll end lobbying as we know it, strengthening our lobbying laws and helping to break the grip that lobbyists have on our government. The voices of corporations and powerful interests shouldn’t be the only voices influencing government—but that’s exactly what’s happened."
"We'll start by strengthening public integrity rules for federal officials in every branch of government, rooting out financial conflicts of interest, and slamming shut the revolving door between government and industry."
My plan lays out the most sweeping set of anti-corruption reforms since Watergate—nearly one hundred proposals. The goal is simple: Take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected and put it back where it belongs—in the hands of the people.
"But these problems didn’t start with Trump. On issue after issue, widely popular policies are blocked because corporations and billionaires use their money and influence to stop any progress. To fix it, we’ll need big, structural change to fundamentally transform our government."

"I've got a few! Tooba, a biology student, flew down from Kalamazoo, Michigan to join us. I also invited Melody, Erin, and Luigi, a few of our local volunteers. And of course, I have my husband Bruce. Houston holds a lot of memories for us—it's where we started dating!"
"At tonight’s #DemDebate, I’m looking forward to talking about our fight to make our government work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. If we work together, we can win in 2020.

Will you chip in $3 to help power our grassroots campaign?"
"Partly because of work and pay discrimination and caregiving responsibilities, women's average monthly Social Security benefits are just 78% of the average monthly benefit for men. That's not right, and my new plan to expand Social Security helps fix it."
It's time to put a stop to racist voter suppression. I've got a plan to stop corrupt politicians from undermining the fundamental right to vote:
"I'm proud to be fighting alongside @maura_healey for big, structural change in 2020. We’re going to do this together."
"Today's Social Security benefits are too small to give retirees financial stability, and the situation is even more dire for Americans who haven’t retired yet. So today I called for the biggest, most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly 50 years."
"Thank you, @SheaCoulee, for representing #TeamWarren and our grassroots movement at @RuPaulsDragCon! Excited to have you in this fight."

"Trump's trade war has cost us 300,000 jobs and is driving us closer to an economic crash—but we’ve still got time to stop it. We need a real plan to save our economy, and I've got one."
Let’s be clear: The wealthiest 0.1% haven't been paying their fair share. I'm not going to let them rig the system for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. This isn’t about winning or losing. My #UltraMillionaireTax will level the playing field for everyone.
Everyone deserves a decent retirement. Try my new retirement calculator to see how much your Social Security benefits would increase under my plan:
Another big benefit: My plan will increase economic growth in the long term and reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next ten years.
So how will we pay for this? Easy. We can immediately increase Social Security benefits and extend the program’s solvency by nearly two decades by asking the top 2% of families to contribute their fair share to the program.

"Those who face work and pay discrimination, like women and caregivers, low-income workers, people of color, and people with disabilities, have lower benefits in retirement. I'll update outdated Social Security rules to ensure everyone gets fairer benefits."
For the 63 million Americans who count on Social Security—including the 10 million Americans with disabilities and their families—my plan will provide more economic security. Money to see the doctor or do necessary home repairs.
"My plan would immediately increase Social Security benefits by $200 a month—$2,400 a year—for every current and future Social Security beneficiary in America. This would immediately lift around 4.9 million seniors out of poverty and cut the senior poverty rate by nearly 70%."
"Social Security has become the main source of retirement income for most seniors, but the benefits today are quite small. 14% of seniors live in poverty—another 28% of seniors are close to it. Seniors are cutting pills and skipping meals to save money. This is unacceptable."
It’s getting harder for families to save enough for a decent retirement. A generation of stagnant wages and rising costs for basics like housing and health care have squeezed family budgets. Millions of Americans are sacrificing saving for retirement just to make ends meet.
We face a retirement crunch that's only going to get worse unless we take bold action. I've got a plan to provide the biggest increase in Social Security benefits in decades—an immediate $200-a-month increase for everyone.
"My stance couldn’t be clearer: These executives and CEOs know the system has been rigged in their favor—and they’ve gotten away with it for a long time.

"It is cruel and unnecessary to separate a kid from their family—especially after surviving Hurricane Dorian. We should be protecting and supporting families fleeing natural disasters, not punishing and traumatizing them."
Let’s be clear: This decision is racist and cruel. We should grant Temporary Protected Status to Bahamians fleeing Hurricane Dorian. A Warren administration will reinstate TPS to protect refugees who are at risk in their home countries.

"Exactly. I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the top reasons is the cost of health care. After my daddy had a heart attack, we lost the family station wagon, and we nearly lost the house."
"Insurance companies. Right now, the system is working great for them. They pull in as many dollars as they can in premiums, and pay out as few dollars as possible for health care. You know firsthand how difficult this system can be even for people with good insurance."
"It looks like #MedicareForAll. Our current system works great for the insurance companies making big profits, but not for the families who have to fight them to get the health care they need. Big, structural change means fighting for a system that works for all of us."
My friend @AdyBarkan understands firsthand how our current health care system is failing patients and their families. I’m honored to be fighting alongside him for #MedicareForAll.
"I took the @TylerClementi Foundation’s Upstander Pledge, because it's time to build a country that works for all of us—and there’s no place for bullying or cruelty in this fight."
It’s true!
You’re doing incredible work. Let’s elect even more moms up and down the ballot!
The gun violence epidemic is growing worse because our nation is being held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists who block any bill. We don't need Trump's half-baked schemes that falsely blame mental illness. Stand up to the gun lobby.
"Stephen Smith is building a people-powered movement to take back the power from corporate executives, lobbyists, and politicians who put their own interests ahead of everyone else. West Virginia can't wait any longer for big, structural change. I'm proud to endorse @WVCantWait!"
"At a time when our reproductive rights are under attack, Illinois deserves a leader with an unwavering commitment to fighting for reproductive health care. I'm proud to endorse @Marie4Congress. She understands this isn’t a moment to back down—it’s time to fight back."
Read my full plan to protect reproductive health care here:
Thousands of Ohio patients will be cut off from reproductive health care because of Republicans’ attacks. We have to fight back. Congress must pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care. And I've got a plan for that. #IStandWithPP
"The people of Texas’ 28th district deserve a Democrat who will be on the side of working people. @JCisnerosTX is that fighter. She knows that when we’re unapologetic about our values and who we’re in this fight for, we win. I'm proud to endorse her!"
".@WorkingFamilies candidate @KendraforPhilly has been a leader in protecting our public schools and ensuring every kid gets a high-quality education. Her passion, commitment, and big ideas will make real change for Philadelphia’s working families. I'm proud to endorse her!"
"Thank you, @scottmstringer—I'm glad to have your support and to be fighting alongside you for big, structural change!"
It was so good to talk with my friend @AdyBarkan and his family. Health care is a basic human right—and we fight for basic human rights. I'm proud to be fighting alongside him for #MedicareForAll.
".@McCreadyForNC knows that if we want to make big, structural change, we have to end corruption in Washington, plain and simple. North Carolina: Remember to get out and vote for Dan in today's special election!"
The American people are better off with John Bolton out of the White House. The world will be better off when the man who hired him in the first place is out too.
I love these! Always grateful to work with talented artists on @TeamWarren.
But that’s why we’re gonna keep fighting for #MedicareForAll—for families like yours and mine. Thank you for opening up your home to me and asking these important questions. We’re in this fight together.
"Exactly. I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the top reasons is the cost of health care. After my daddy had a heart attack, we lost the family station wagon, and we nearly lost the house."

"This will be a moment of determination. Determination to change.

I stand with @GiffordsCourage and my fellow candidates in the fight to end gun violence. Our next president must be a #GunSafetyPresident."
"This is a tough fight, but there's always room for a little fun! Tune in on Tuesday for my full conversation with @AdyBarkan (and Carl and his space shuttle)."
"Our military families are being left with cramped, decaying schools so Trump can build his hateful border wall. This is a disgrace."
"I couldn't do any of this without Bruce, my family, and @TeamWarren. We're going to build the America of our dreams together."
No need to stand on ceremony here—@AdyBarkan and I have been friends for a long time. Be sure to watch our full conversation on health care and #MedicareForAll Tuesday on @nowthisnews.
"I am not afraid—and if Democrats are going to win, you can’t be afraid either. This is our moment in history. This is our moment to dream big and fight hard. Thank you, @NHDems! #NHDems2020"
"Everyone should own a piece of our democracy. At the #NHDems2020 convention, I talked about how we’re building a grassroots movement.

No PACs and giant corporations, just people—in New Hampshire and all around our country. Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020!"
The energy of our grassroots movement—that’s what keeps me going. Thank you for coming out today for the #NHDems2020 convention!
"Corruption.

Plain and simple.

This is why I’ve introduced the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate. #EndCorruptionNow"
We must call out these hateful attacks wherever and whenever they happen. LGBTQ+ Americans should be able to live free from fear or discrimination. I’m fighting for your rights every day.
That’s my guy.
Woo-hoo! Let’s do this. #NHDems2020
"Four auto manufacturers decided to reject Donald Trump’s rollback of fuel economy standards. Now Trump's using the Justice Department to attack those companies for embarrassing him.

That’s disgraceful."
"Bailey ""helped"" me with grassroots donor call time yesterday."
"For some candidates, “call time” means dialing up millionaires and asking for big checks.

Not me. Last night, I spent “call time” thanking supporters and talking with voters. Will you chip in $3 to our grassroots campaign? I might call you to say thanks!"
".@AdyBarkan is fighting to make sure every family has the health care they need. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. I'm proud to be fighting alongside Ady for #MedicareForAll."
I’m proud to support @UNITEHERE26 as they fight for a fair contract—because one job should be enough. #1job #1u
"Defense contractor influence is part of why we have a wasteful, unsustainable Pentagon budget. It's corruption, plain and simple. I'll make real cuts, and I've introduced sweeping anti-corruption legislation to limit lobbyist influence at the Pentagon."
"On my first day as president, I will sign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands. And I will ban fracking—everywhere."
Tell your mom it was great chatting with her! Thanks for being a part of this grassroots movement. This is how we’ll win—together.

We need universal free public college and technical school so students can graduate without crushing debt. And I've got a plan to cancel student loan debt for more than 95% of Americans who hold it. Find out how much of your debt my plan would cancel:
Betsy DeVos's Education Department is denying nearly all applications for the updated Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and making it very difficult to apply for the program at all. It's time to fix this student loan debt crisis once and for all.
I’m sorry I missed you! I’m grateful down to my toes for everything you’ve done for this grassroots movement.
"This is immoral. Our laws and values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. As president, I'll welcome at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term."
The #GreenNewDeal isn't just about reducing our emissions. It's also about making sure American workers have good green jobs. My Green Manufacturing Plan will create 1.2 million of those jobs—getting us one big step closer to that goal.
I absolutely love your designs! Thank you so much—I’m grateful down to my toes.
Mike Pence went out of his way to line the president’s pockets with taxpayer money by staying at Trump’s hotel. That has a name: Corruption—plain and simple.
"The fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about light bulbs and cheeseburgers so we don't talk about how 70% of pollution comes from transportation, electricity production, and buildings.

I won't be sidetracked—we need bold action to fight climate change."
Undocumented leaders and organizers have done incredible work. Now it's on us to act. We should immediately reinstate DACA—and then give Dreamers and their families a fair and achievable path to citizenship.
"Thanks for being on the call and in this fight, Katya!"
No such thing as being “uncool.” Glad I got to meet you both! Grateful down to my toes for your support.
"The Amazon fires are accelerating the climate crisis, and indigenous communities are being disproportionately impacted. In the U.S. and around the world, we must fight climate change and protect indigenous lands. #Sept5Act4Amazonia"
What the Trump administration has done to these children and their families is cruel and inhumane. We must stop unnecessary detention.
Farmers want to be stewards of our land and part of the solution to climate change—and we should be supporting them. That's why my plan will provide farmers with the tools and resources they need to invest in sustainable farming practices.
"The best part of the #ClimateTownHall was getting to see all of the incredible young activists who built a grassroots movement to make it happen. That's how we'll stop climate change—by dreaming big, fighting hard, and organizing together!"
"The fossil fuel industry wants to keep us arguing about light bulbs and cheeseburgers while 70% of pollution comes from just three industries. We need to focus on creating big, structural change to tackle this climate crisis and the Washington corruption head-on. #ClimateTownHall"
"You don’t get to ruin the air, the water, and the soil for everyone else because it increases your profitability. #ClimateTownHall"
"Washington is taking money from fossil fuel industries and big polluters and doing exactly what they want, which is mostly nothing. As long as those guys continue to call the shots, we won’t be able to make the changes we need. #ClimateTownHall"
"I just stepped off the stage at the @CNN #ClimateTownHall. In a Warren administration, I’ll fight my heart out for our environment—from ending new fossil leases on public lands to investing $2 trillion in green research.

"Why has Washington been dragging its feet on fighting the climate crisis? Corruption, plain and simple."
Barriers that hamper reentry for formerly incarcerated people—like restrictions on occupational licensing—make it harder for those who have served their time to find work and fully rejoin their communities. We should remove those barriers.
"If we want more good American jobs, we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people. That's why we need #UnionsForAll."
This undermines Congress’ constitutional duties and is an insult to our service members. Trump’s border wall isn’t about security—it’s nothing more than a sign of his administration’s hate.

"This is exactly why fines aren’t good enough. When executives of major companies knowingly hurt people through criminal negligence, they should face real criminal penalties."
"This is a good start—but it's not nearly enough. Walmart can and should do much more. And we need real gun reform, now."
This is inhumane. Our government must provide those in our care with all the health and sanitary products they need.
We need strong enforcement of our campaign finance laws —and that means a fully functioning Federal Election Commission.
"Thank you, New Hampshire, for letting me spend Labor Day with you! Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win together."
"I began my campaign in Lawrence, MA, where textile workers—mostly women, nearly all immigrants—went on strike after their pay was cut. They put aside their differences and fought together for a better life. Their fight inspires and moves us today."
"No matter how many times strikers and organizers have been told ""it’s too hard, give up now,"" they've persisted. When workers organize and fight together, they win—and they can change America. #LaborDay"

DoorDash—recently caught pocketing tips intended for their drivers—is joining the fight for a ballot initiative that will allow them to exploit their workers and deny them protections. All Democrats should speak out against this proposed ballot measure.
"Glad I got a chance to talk with ABS-CBN News about improving access to health care, strengthening our economy, and reforming our immigration system. I’m in this fight all the way for Filipino families and to build an America that lives up to our values."
Gun violence is a public health crisis—and our country is being held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists. I will break the NRA’s stranglehold on Congress and sign comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation within my first 100 days.
"My thoughts are with the people of the Bahamas today as they face #HurricaneDorian.

Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina: Be prepared, make sure you have an emergency plan, and stay safe."
I'm heartsick for the victims of this latest mass shooting in Odessa and Midland. We shouldn't have to live with this near daily fear and horror. We've already lost far too many to gun violence—Congress must act now.
"Uber and Lyft are prepared to spend millions so they can continue classifying their workers as ""independent contractors"" to exploit them and deny them protections. The California Senate must pass AB 5, and all Democrats should fight this ballot measure."
I will nominate a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher—Betsy DeVos need not apply.

"As Hurricane Dorian nears Florida, please be prepared and stay safe."

"I began my campaign in Lawrence, MA, where textile workers—mostly women, nearly all immigrants—went on strike after their pay was cut. They put aside their differences and fought together for a better life. Their fight inspires and moves us today."
"No matter how many times strikers and organizers have been told ""it’s too hard, give up now,"" they've persisted. When workers organize and fight together, they win—and they can change America. #LaborDay"
"Unions built the middle class—and unions will rebuild the middle class. If we want more good American jobs, then we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people. I’m proud to be fighting alongside our unions. #LaborDay"
DoorDash—recently caught pocketing tips intended for their drivers—is joining the fight for a ballot initiative that will allow them to exploit their workers and deny them protections. All Democrats should speak out against this proposed ballot measure.
"Glad I got a chance to talk with ABS-CBN News about improving access to health care, strengthening our economy, and reforming our immigration system. I’m in this fight all the way for Filipino families and to build an America that lives up to our values."
Gun violence is a public health crisis—and our country is being held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists. I will break the NRA’s stranglehold on Congress and sign comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation within my first 100 days.
"My thoughts are with the people of the Bahamas today as they face #HurricaneDorian.

Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina: Be prepared, make sure you have an emergency plan, and stay safe."
I'm heartsick for the victims of this latest mass shooting in Odessa and Midland. We shouldn't have to live with this near daily fear and horror. We've already lost far too many to gun violence—Congress must act now.
"Uber and Lyft are prepared to spend millions so they can continue classifying their workers as ""independent contractors"" to exploit them and deny them protections. The California Senate must pass AB 5, and all Democrats should fight this ballot measure."
I will nominate a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher—Betsy DeVos need not apply.
"I’m proud of the movement we’re building together. We can dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020—with a campaign that’s 100% grassroots-funded. Own a piece of our campaign and chip in whatever you can before midnight."
"As Hurricane Dorian nears Florida, please be prepared and stay safe."
"I’m not taking applications from billionaires to start a Super PAC for me. You won’t find me at a fancy fundraiser asking millionaires for big checks.

Instead, people like you make this campaign possible. Will you chip in $3 before our August deadline?"
"Trump is lying about his calls with China because his trade war is failing, and he's scrambling. We need a real plan to fix our economy before there’s another downturn. I’ve got one."
I'm not going to let giant corporations dictate America's trade policy anymore. I'll make sure our trade policies create and defend good American jobs and raise wages—and that unions and labor will have a seat at the negotiating table.
"As he tries to compensate for his own mishandling of the economy, Donald Trump appears to be floating a tax giveaway that would go almost entirely to the wealthy. He has no plan except more looting to reward his rich buddies."
"The people of Hong Kong deserve the rights promised to them by the Chinese government. 

The world is watching."
This is depraved and inhumane. The Trump administration must allow these vulnerable immigrants to stay and receive treatment.
"We can fight climate change if we take bold actions. My green manufacturing plan will invest $2 trillion in green research, manufacturing, and exporting over the next ten years—creating 1.2 million good American jobs, and helping clean up our planet."
"For a lot of candidates, “call-time” means hopping on the phone to ask wealthy donors for big checks.

Not me.

I spend “call-time” talking with voters and grassroots donors. Will I call you next? Chip in $3 now."
"2020 is our chance to:

✅ Return the power to the people
✅ Save our planet from climate change
✅ Make our economy work for working families

Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can right now to help make it happen?"
Climate change is an existential crisis. We should be enforcing and strengthening our environmental regulations—not rolling them back.
"If you own a home, you already pay a wealth tax—it’s just called a property tax. My #UltraMillionaireTax makes sure the 75,000 wealthiest American families pay their fair share of taxes on all other forms of wealth too, so everyone has a chance to succeed."
The Trump administration’s cruelty knows no bounds. Making it harder for the children of even one U.S. service member to achieve citizenship is a dishonor to everyone who serves.
"Grateful down to my toes for your support, @BrandonCCD1! Let’s win this fight together."
I'm standing in solidarity with @UNITEHERE26 as they push @WestmontHotels for a fair contract at the Battery Wharf Hotel. My campaign and I won’t spend any money at the Battery Wharf Hotel until this labor dispute is settled—because one job should be enough. #1job #1u
"I'm excited to be on the Democratic debate stage again on Thursday, September 12th to talk about the big, structural change we're fighting for!"
"Nicol wants to be a doctor.
Hilary wants to be an engineer.
Ilich wants to be an American.

As president, I'll reverse the Trump administration's cruel ""Remain in Mexico"" policy and ensure that asylum seekers will be welcomed at ports of entry."
My plan to protect our democracy would put an end to this kind of voter suppression. No more registration problems. No more voter purges. And no more letting states make it even more difficult for historically disenfranchised populations to vote.
"This has to stop. Politicians are supposed to compete over how many young voters they can turn out, not how many they can keep from the polls."
"If we want to fix the criminal justice system, we have to listen to those who have been directly impacted by it. I was proud to sit down with @BetterFuturesMN—and I’m ready to fight alongside them."
We’re up against our August fundraising deadline at the end of the week. Will you chip in $3 right now to our 100% grassroots-funded campaign? I might just call you to say thanks!
"I’m grateful down to my toes to fight alongside you, Emmanuel. Let’s build a better world for every child in America."

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream lives on. It’s our responsibility to carry on the fight for justice.
"Thank you for being part of this race, @SenGillibrand, and for your unwavering commitment to fighting for women—from reproductive rights to paid leave. Your voice has been strong and clear, and your determination is always on display. I'm proud to keep fighting alongside you."
"After release from prison, people are more likely to be unemployed, more likely to be rearrested, and more likely to overdose. Why? In part, because our prisons are not fulfilling their rehabilitative function. I talked with @BetterFuturesMN about my plan to change that."
"Not good enough. Under my Corporate Executive Accountability Act, executives of major companies that knowingly hurt people through criminal negligence won’t just pay a fine, they'll face real criminal penalties."
"It is our responsibility now to carry on the fight for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. We must continue the work—today and every day—for social, racial, and economic justice."
"I'm particularly concerned that Trump is pulling millions of dollars from FEMA to detain more immigrants and implement his administration’s inhumane immigration policies. This is a cruel, dangerous move—especially at the height of hurricane season."
"As Dorian heads towards Puerto Rico, the Trump administration must be prepared to provide assistance and resources. Puerto Rico is still suffering the effects of last season's hurricanes. Now is not the time for insults, delays, or playing politics. Lives and homes are at risk."
How candidates fund their campaigns matters. Ours has been 100% grassroots-funded since the beginning. No PACs or closed-door meetings with millionaires or CEOs—just people like you chipping in what they can. Will you donate $3 and join the movement?
This is a welcome—but temporary—victory. Make no mistake: These threats will continue. Congress must pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care from right-wing ideologues.
"Big internet service providers have excluded millions of families from fast, reliable internet access in order to maximize their profits. I've got a plan to fix that."
"Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. I'm proud to be fighting alongside my friend @AdyBarkan for #MedicareForAll."
"Grateful down to my toes for your support, Alyssa. We’re gonna do this—together."
"Here’s the idea: My #UltraMillionaireTax is a two cent tax on the 75,000 biggest fortunes in the country. So. What can we do with those two cents? Here are just a few things."
"We have to protect our public lands for future generations. That’s why, on my first day as president, I'll sign an executive order that sets a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases, including for drilling offshore and on public lands."
"You might’ve heard, but I’ve got a plan for that"
Trans and non-binary people shouldn't have to face invasive and dehumanizing screenings to travel. We must do better—and I’ll keep working to ensure that every trans and non-binary American is able to live without fear or discrimination.
"I can’t do this alone.

Person by person, we’re building a grassroots movement together. Can I count on you to chip in $3 or whatever you can to help keep up the momentum?"
"On #WomensEqualityDay we celebrate the progress we've made for women's rights, and acknowledge how much further we have to go. #EqualityCantWait—it's time to pass the Equal Rights Amendment."
Thank you to everyone who got out there and knocked doors for our #WeekendOfAction. This is how we’re going to win this fight—together.
"Happy #NationalDogDay to our very good boy, Bailey!"

We need a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote—and we need to take action now to put a stop to racist voter suppression. I’ve got a plan for that.
"The 19th Amendment enshrined a woman's right to vote in the Constitution, but the right to vote for women of color wasn't protected until the Voting Rights Act in 1965. In 2013 the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, and voter suppression is on the rise. #WomensEqualityDay"
I can’t wait to meet her and hear all about her plans! Thank you for being in this fight.
Let’s win!
"I stand with all the @CWAUnion members who are making their voices heard. @ATT must respect workers' rights to join a union and bargain collectively, and they should come to the negotiating table in good faith. #ATTUnfair"
"As part of my plan to combat the opioid crisis, I'll invest $100 billion for prevention, treatment, and recovery services in the states and communities on the front lines of this crisis. It's time to treat this epidemic like the public health crisis it is."
"Under my Corporate Executive Accountability Act, executives of major companies that knowingly hurt people through criminal negligence—such as fueling the opioid crisis—will face real criminal penalties for their actions."
"It's encouraging to see @JNJCares held responsible for their role in fueling the opioid crisis, but this penalty is much smaller than the harm they've done—or the money they made. We need more accountability, and more resources to fight this crisis."
I don’t want a government that works for giant corporations. I want one that works for our families.
I never get tired of these!
"I love this! 

But did Spencer ever get to finish the last chapter, @TheRock?"
"Whenever I meet a little girl, I tell them ""I'm running for president because that's what girls do."" Then we pinky promise that they'll remember. I want every girl to know that when they fight from the heart, they can win. #WomensEqualityDay"
"Good luck to all the college students heading back to class this week. You’ve got this! Know I’m fighting for you all the way—from canceling student loan debt to making public college and technical schools free. (PS: Yep, that’s me as a college freshman in a dress I made myself)."
"Thank you, Seattle! I’m grateful for all of the hugs and photos, and a great conversation about how we’re going to make our government work for the people."
Smiling ear to ear!
Can’t wait for the Season 5 premiere of @BallersHBO tonight (Bruce and I still can't believe there won't be a Season 6). And congrats @TheRock on your marriage!
"In just a few moments, we’ll be live from our Seattle town hall! Tune in to join us."
"Donald Trump is a walking, talking conflict of interest. No president should be allowed to push the rules of our government to benefit their personal bottom line. My anti-corruption bill—the biggest since Watergate—tackles this kind of corruption head on."
"Art Ramalho was an icon, not just in the boxing world, but in the fight for change. It was an honor to work with him during our 2012 campaign. He taught me how to be a fighter. Thinking about him and his loved ones today."
"Two years ago the Burmese military began a campaign that killed thousands of Rohingya and forced over 700,000 people to flee their homes. Today and every day we must stand up for the Rohingya, for reconciliation and  accountability in Burma, and for human rights around the world."

"A lot of giant companies refer to themselves as “American.” But let’s face it, they only have one real loyalty: Their shareholders. A Warren administration will halt the hollowing out of American cities and create good American jobs. Here’s how."
"It's going to take big ideas and bold, structural changes to achieve the goals of the #GreenNewDeal. Climate change is an existential threat to all of us—and we need to act now."
"Every American deserves a safe, decent, and affordable place to live—in Iowa and across the country. It's going to take big, structural change to tackle this crisis, and I've got a plan for that:"
"So good to see you, Randi—we’ll get a real selfie next time!"
"Great job, Atticus!"
"Right now in America, working people are getting squeezed. Wages have barely budged for a generation, but the cost of housing, health care, and education is rising. It's time to level the playing field. 

I’m running for president to make our government work for the people again."
My plan for immigration reform will end unnecessary detention—but I’ll also enforce strict standards for medical care for anyone in our custody. The government has a basic responsibility to keep the people in its care safe and healthy.
At least three children held in U.S. custody have already died of the flu. This is cruel and inhumane—and it will lead to more preventable deaths.
Climate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us—and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate.
Donald Trump has no strategy or plan. His reckless actions drove his own companies into bankruptcy—now they threaten the global economy and increase the risk of a recession that will hit working families hardest.
"I believe down to my bones that we can make our government work for the people. It’s the fight of our lives—but I’m not afraid, because we’re in it together."
"There was a lot of energy at our town hall in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Day by day, community by community, we’re building a movement together."
"Great meeting you, Sarah! Thanks for being in this fight."
"Yup. The time for small ideas is over. We’ve got to be the party of big, structural change."
"“Student loan debt.”

That’s an answer I get a lot when I’m talking to voters about why they’re in this fight with me. If we turn my plan to cancel student debt and make public college free into action, we can free an entire generation of Americans."
"We can’t make big, structural change unless we elect Democratic women up and down the ticket and across the country. I’m proud to support you and all the women like you who have stepped up to put their names on a ballot!"
"The #AmazonRainforest is still burning, with thousands of acres of wildlife in flames. World leaders must come together to end this crisis—and President Bolsonaro must step up and take responsibility for these fires and their consequences."
"We have a moral responsibility to protect our planet. My Green Manufacturing Plan invests $2 trillion over the next ten years in green research, manufacturing, and exporting. It will link American innovation directly to American jobs, and help us reach a #GreenNewDeal."
"Every single day of this campaign matters. As Democrats, we have to be willing to get out there and fight for our country. No more defense—we need to play offense and be the party of big, structural change."
"Black women are more likely to be breadwinners for their families, yet they’re paid less on average. That’s just wrong. We have a lot of work to do to close that pay gap—and I’m in this fight all the way. #BlackWomensEqualPay"

"It should be quick and easy for anyone to join a union, including graduate student workers. I stand with student workers at @BostonCollege and at universities across the country who want to unionize. Their voices must be heard."
My granddaughter Lavinia helped me welcome the crowd last night at our Los Angeles town hall. I love being her Gammy and sharing this fight with my family.
"Every kid should know that when they fight from the heart, they can win—and that includes running for president. And we pinky promise so they won’t forget."
We need to do everything we can to support “gig economy” workers. It’s time for all Democrats to support AB 5 and back full employee status for gig workers.
"It was great meeting your family, Julia! I’m so glad to have you (and your munchkin) in this fight for big structural change."
"Yay! Thank you Los Angeles, and thank you Laura and Kelly!"
"Climate change is an existential crisis we all face—and it’s going to take big, structural change to solve it. I can’t wait to talk about my plans to protect our planet and tackle climate change at the @CNN Climate Crisis Town Hall next month!"
"I loved her cardigan! Thank you both for coming out last night, it was wonderful to meet you."
"Surprise, surprise. Donald Trump and his administration are rolling back regulations for their Wall Street big bank buddies. The rich and powerful are tilting the rules to work in their favor, putting everyone else at risk.

That ends when I’m president."
"Our punitive system does little to keep us safer—and it is separating families and devastating entire communities. If we want real justice in this country, we have to make big, structural changes to reform the criminal justice system."
"For the exact same crimes, Black Americans are more likely than whites to be arrested, charged, wrongfully convicted, and given harsher sentences. The evidence is clear that there are structural race problems in the criminal justice system. #1619Project"
"I hope to see you there! Chip in any amount to our 100% grassroots-funded campaign, and you’ll be automatically entered to win."
America’s public lands are our greatest treasures. But the Trump administration is selling them off to oil and gas companies for pennies on the dollar. It doesn’t have to be this way—and I have a plan to clean up their mess:
Trans immigrants like Zuleika—and other vulnerable asylum seekers—face unimaginable risks while the Trump administration forces them to wait in Mexico. My immigration plan ensures they'll be safely and humanely welcomed at ports of entry.
"Feeling inspired after our Los Angeles town hall tonight, and especially loved having my family there with me. Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win. Thank you, California!"
Everyone gets a photo!
Thank you @JayInslee for fighting every day to make sure that climate change remains a primary focus of this election. Climate change is real and it's a crisis—and I will keep fighting alongside you to take bold action before it is too late.
"Woo-hoo! In just a few minutes, we’re going live at our Los Angeles town hall. Be sure to tune in:"
Thank you so much for visiting our headquarters. I’m in this fight for you and your family.
"It was the hottest July on record. Our glaciers are melting at a record pace. And now the #AmazonRainforest is burning at record speed.

Make no mistake: This affects all of us. We must take bold action to stop climate change—now."
"It should be quick and easy for anyone to join a union, including graduate student workers. I stand with student workers at @BostonCollege and at universities across the country who want to unionize. Their voices must be heard."
My granddaughter Lavinia helped me welcome the crowd last night at our Los Angeles town hall. I love being her Gammy and sharing this fight with my family.
"Every kid should know that when they fight from the heart, they can win—and that includes running for president. And we pinky promise so they won’t forget."
We need to do everything we can to support “gig economy” workers. It’s time for all Democrats to support AB 5 and back full employee status for gig workers.
"It was great meeting your family, Julia! I’m so glad to have you (and your munchkin) in this fight for big structural change."
"Yay! Thank you Los Angeles, and thank you Laura and Kelly!"
"Climate change is an existential crisis we all face—and it’s going to take big, structural change to solve it. I can’t wait to talk about my plans to protect our planet and tackle climate change at the @CNN Climate Crisis Town Hall next month!"
"I loved her cardigan! Thank you both for coming out last night, it was wonderful to meet you."
"Surprise, surprise. Donald Trump and his administration are rolling back regulations for their Wall Street big bank buddies. The rich and powerful are tilting the rules to work in their favor, putting everyone else at risk.

That ends when I’m president."

"I’m flattered, Gabe. Dementors or big bank CEOs, I’m ready to take ‘em on—let’s do this!"
"Our criminal justice system is stacked against Tera’s family. She worries her brothers won’t be able to break the cycle of incarceration. 

We must end cash bail, invest in public defenders and mental health treatment, and help formerly incarcerated people succeed."
"What a sweetie. I’m glad to meet with any future voter, Brian!"
Looking forward to our Los Angeles town hall later this evening! I hope you’ll tune in at 6:00 PM PT to join us live:
"Unions built the middle class, and unions will rebuild the middle class. Thank you @IowaAFLCIO for having me today. I’m proud to stand with America’s workers."
"Rain or shine, we persist! I’m so grateful for your support."
"Robert and James, I’m so grateful that you’re getting in this fight with me. Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win!"
"The Flores agreement mandates that migrant children cannot be held in detention for more than 20 days. Today, the Trump administration announced its plans to roll back Flores—putting thousands of children in danger. We must fight this."
I've argued for years that corporate capture of the federal courts is a serious problem. It's getting worse. The next president must address it—and that starts by committing to dramatically increase the professional diversity of the federal bench.
"Tonight’s town hall in Los Angeles will be a lot of fun—and the good news is that anyone can join. Bookmark this link, then tune in at 6:00 PM PT to join us live!"
The Bailey bandana is my favorite! #TeamWarren
I love it!
It would've been even better if she’d brought her own Bailey!
"Donald Trump and his team have hurt the economy, and now they can't get their stories straight on half-baked ideas to clean up the mess they caused. If they want an actual plan for how to avert another economic downturn, they should read mine."
The period after release from prison is challenging. I was honored to talk to @BetterFuturesMN about my plan to reform our criminal justice system and learn about the important work they do to help returning citizens with re-entry.
"Happy birthday, Lisa! Let’s dream big and fight hard together so that your birthday wish comes true."
"Persist, @DelegateGuzman!"
I’m grateful that Brittany and Nikki came to our St. Paul town hall!
Notes from last night’s town hall! Can’t wait to read them.
"Thanks for chatting with me, Ruth! I’m ready to work hard for the people of Minnesota."

I promised Willa’s dad: We’re going to fight for an America where every kid has a chance to succeed.
"I loved meeting you and your whole family, Andrew! Can’t wait to see Cora run for president one day."
Let’s hear it for Minnesota! I’m thankful for everyone who came out to our St. Paul town hall last night. We had a lot of fun—and took a lot of photos.
"Hope you had a great birthday, Kevin!"
"I’m glad to have met you, Bryce! I am so grateful to be in this fight alongside you."
Great meeting you both! Thank you for fighting to hold Big Ag accountable.
Yes we do. Proud to fight alongside @ItsDShawna every day.
"We need to repeal the 1994 crime bill. It was a mistake, and the bulk of it needs to go."
The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Our policies are tearing families apart and devastating communities—and they aren't making us safer. I've got a plan to completely reform the criminal justice system from front to back.
"If the Trump administration gets its way on this, employers could legally fire trans Americans just for being themselves. This is discrimination, plain and simple, and we’re going to fight it with everything we’ve got."
"Washington is failing Native communities, and it's time to fulfill our obligations to Tribal Nations. Deeply grateful for the opportunity to speak at #NativeVote2020 yesterday."
"Great meeting you and your sister, Rachel. Persist!"
Looking great!
"I stand with @PPact.

The Trump administration’s gag rule is a deliberate attempt to keep providers like Planned Parenthood from serving patients—and an attack on women with low incomes who depend on them to get the care they need. We’ll fight this."
"Our system is the result of choices we’ve made—choices that together stack the deck against the poor and the disadvantaged. We can create real law and order and real justice in our country by making long overdue big, structural change."
"The majority of people in prison will be returned to their communities. We should ensure that returning citizens have a chance to succeed, by reducing discrimination and promoting opportunity during reentry and eliminating needlessly punitive parole requirements."
"As we fight to end mass incarceration, we need to ensure humane conditions for those who are imprisoned. That means meeting basic human rights standards, protecting vulnerable populations, investing in rehabilitation programs, and expanding mental health and addiction treatment."
"The president can grant clemency and pardons herself. I'll empower a clemency board to make recommendations directly to the White House, identifying broad classes of potentially-deserving individuals for review, such as those serving mandatory minimums that should be abolished."
"Our criminal system places enormous power in the hands of the state, and we need better checks in place to ensure that it's just: by investing in our public defenders, reining in prosecutorial abuses, and allowing those wrongfully imprisoned to challenge their conviction."
"Officers who violate someone's constitutional rights are often shielded from civil rights lawsuits by qualified immunity. That’s wrong—and needs to change. When an officer abuses the law, that’s bad for law enforcement, victims, and communities."

"Most police officers sign up so they can protect their communities. But too many people of color have experienced trauma at the hands of law enforcement. It’s time to change how we police: funding what works, and building trust between police and the communities they serve."
"We also have to stop criminalizing poverty. As president, I will fight to end cash bail and limit excessive fines and fees. There’s no justice in imposing high, punitive financial burdens on those who are least able to bear them."
"Next, we have to rethink what we choose to criminalize. That starts with repealing the 1994 crime bill—the bulk of which needs to go—and legalizing marijuana. Overcriminalization has filled prisons and devastated communities—and it's time for it to end."
"Investing in public safety should mean investing in good schools, safe housing, access to mental health services and treatment for addiction, protecting LGBTQ+ Americans, and violence intervention programs diverting young people from criminal activity—before police are involved."
"Let's start by reimagining how we talk about public safety. It's a false choice to suggest a tradeoff between safety and mass incarceration. Instead of putting people in prison, we should focus on services that lift people up and make our communities safer."
"The U.S. makes up 5% of the world's population, but nearly 20% of the world's prison population. And the evidence is clear that there are structural race problems in our criminal justice system. At every level, the system disadvantages or discriminates against people of color."
"The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world—yet our harshly punitive system isn’t making our communities safer. I've got a plan to make big, structural changes at every step of the criminal justice system:"
"Here’s the bottom line: If Dimon and the Business Roundtable are serious about their statement, we need to see real action. They can start by empowering workers and supporting my Accountable Capitalism plan."
Another question: Dimon and the Business Roundtable have been busy lobbying for NAFTA 2.0. Will they change their tune now and back American workers and unions who are fighting for a better agreement?
"Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, leads the group that put out yesterday's statement. Will he put his money where his mouth is and actually raise pay for workers instead of spending billions on stock buybacks for shareholders?"
"A year ago, I called out CEOs and the Business Roundtable for their single-minded focus on maximizing shareholder value at the expense of workers. Looks like they finally got the memo. But without real action, their announcement is meaningless."
"Thank you to everyone who came out to our St. Paul town hall this evening! Minnesota is ready to fight for big, structural change."
"Today at the @4DirectionsVote #NativeVote2020 presidential forum, @Deb4CongressNM and I talked about our new proposal: The Honoring Promises to Native Nations Act. Our federal government owes Native communities a fighting chance to build stronger communities and brighter futures."
"Where our country spends its money tells you about our values. That’s why full funding for tribal infrastructure, education, and health care is at the heart of my ideas for Indian Country. #NativeVote2020"
"A problem not seen is a problem not fixed. We must raise awareness and tackle the ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. My administration will launch an unprecedented initiative to collect data, empower Tribal Nations, and address this crisis. #NativeVote2020"
"Proud to fight alongside you, @Deb4CongressNM!"
Our federal government must recognize its ongoing failure to honor its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. Proud to work alongside @Deb4CongressNM on a proposal to uphold the federal government’s promises to Tribal Nations and empower Native communities.
I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to participate in @4DirectionsVote’s #NativeVote2020 forum this morning. It’s time for Tribal Nations to have the resources they need to see the prosperity they deserve.
"Glad to see some justice for Eric Garner and his family. But Daniel Pantaleo should have been fired a long time ago. And our criminal justice system needs big, structural change."
"I met with Frank LaMere's family before today’s Native American Presidential Forum. I first met Frank when I launched my campaign, and I'm proud to talk today about how we can carry on his legacy by strengthening the relationship between the federal government and Tribal Nations."

"The CFPB student loan ombudsman is supposed to protect students from getting cheated. But the Trump administration’s pick for the job is an executive at a student loan servicer that got over 9,000 complaints from borrowers. In my administration, the CFPB will work for the people."
Let’s hear it for America’s public school teachers!
"These guys are looking good in Columbia, SC."
"Congratulations on your final treatment, Claire. Your strength inspires me. Persist!"
"Yesterday, I talked with @BlackChurchPac about how the Black maternal mortality crisis is threatening the lives of Black women. I’m way past “Let’s raise awareness about this problem.” We have to do something about it."
"I took on giant banks, and I beat them.
I took on Wall Street C.E.O.s, and I beat them.
I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator, and I beat him.

When we fight, we win—and I’m not afraid of a fight."

"Wells Fargo forced Xavier to close out his accounts, yet he was still hit with over $1,000 worth of overdraft fees. It’s not right. I’ve been fighting for years to hold Wells Fargo accountable, and I’m not going to stop until they clean up their act."
"I'm speaking live at @blackchurchpac now about the big, structural change we're fighting for. Tune in!"
It’s an honor to fight alongside @GabbyGiffords and @GiffordsCourage to end gun violence.
"With a North Country view like this, you’d move fast too."
"We’re in this fight together—for our children, for our communities, and for our future."
"Since an extreme Ohio law eliminating funding for @PPFA went into effect, the system has struggled to keep up, putting women’s health at risk.

"I’m proud to team up with @Deb4CongressNM on our new bill to uphold our responsibilities to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples and provide them with predictable, guaranteed funding."
Proud to fight alongside @PaaWeeRivera every day.
"We must stand united with Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples to ensure that Native voices are heard and their rights are respected. With real structural change, we can write a new story."
"Thank you, @Deb4CongressNM. It’s an honor to fight alongside you."
To everyone who gives me letters at town halls: Thank you! These came from the people of Nevada after our Henderson town hall. I love reading about what gets you in this fight—we’re in it together.
"I got a lot of letters to read at our first-ever town hall in Arizona. Your stories inspire me to keep fighting. And yes, Casey: I’ll give Bailey an extra pet for you!"
"I’ve fought for a brighter future for Tribal Nations during my time in the Senate and I’m proud to work with @Deb4CongressNM on our new bill in Congress. And when we win the White House, I’ll be committed to achieving that future as President of the United States."
"Right-wing courts have ruled that religious freedom laws allow corporations to deny employees birth control, but don’t protect tribes that object to dumping sewage water on sacred sites. Absurd. Congress should pass a new law protecting tribal religious interests in sacred sites."
"When tribal concerns have conflicted with corporate profits or resource extraction, tribes lose. This has to change. When I’m president, energy projects that impact Indian Country won’t proceed without consent. That means revoking Trump’s KeystoneXL and DAPL permits."
"In 2013, the Violence Against Women Act crucially recognized some criminal jurisdiction by Tribal Nations, and I support reauthorizing and building on it. But we need to go further and I support a full Oliphant fix."
Washington has refused to fully respect tribal sovereignty in criminal justice matters. This has deprived countless crime victims the opportunity to get justice. And it has fed the ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. This must change. #MMIW
"Funding critical programs for Indian Country isn't optional. It's required to fulfill the United States’ trust and treaty obligations. So @Deb4CongressNM and I have teamed up on writing a bill to ensure predictable, guaranteed funding to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples."
"Washington is failing Native communities, and it's time to fulfill our obligations to Tribal Nations. Today I’m announcing ideas to ensure that tribal sovereignty and our trust and treaty obligations are binding legal and moral principles—not just slogans."
"Last month, the FTC tweeted and advertised that the nearly 150 million Americans who had their data exposed in the @Equifax breach were eligible for $125 each in compensation.

Now they’re saying, “Just kidding!” I’m demanding answers."
My heart breaks for Tracy Single and her loved ones. This is an escalating crisis—and we need to treat it like one.
Our Grassroots Donor Wall is almost done! Every sticker has the names of Americans who’ve chipped in to help build our movement. I’m proud of this 100% grassroots-funded campaign! There’s still time for your name to be included—will you donate $3 now?
"Eight towns, four days, one RV—and lots of terrific people and delicious food at the @IowaStateFair! Iowans are fired up to make real change in 2020, and it inspires me down to my bones. Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at our week in Iowa."
"At our Wolfeboro house party last night, I listened to grassroots supporters explain why they’re in this fight.

One thing’s clear: People are determined to win in 2020 and make our government work for the people!"
"I love the North Country! Grateful to everyone who came out to our Franconia town hall yesterday. From ending the opioid epidemic to leveling the playing field for rural workers, I’m in this fight for the people of New Hampshire."
You’ve got this. Good luck!
"I’m proud to team up with @Deb4CongressNM on our new bill to uphold our responsibilities to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples and provide them with predictable, guaranteed funding."
Proud to fight alongside @PaaWeeRivera every day.
"We must stand united with Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples to ensure that Native voices are heard and their rights are respected. With real structural change, we can write a new story."
"Thank you, @Deb4CongressNM. It’s an honor to fight alongside you."
To everyone who gives me letters at town halls: Thank you! These came from the people of Nevada after our Henderson town hall. I love reading about what gets you in this fight—we’re in it together.
"I got a lot of letters to read at our first-ever town hall in Arizona. Your stories inspire me to keep fighting. And yes, Casey: I’ll give Bailey an extra pet for you!"
"I’ve fought for a brighter future for Tribal Nations during my time in the Senate and I’m proud to work with @Deb4CongressNM on our new bill in Congress. And when we win the White House, I’ll be committed to achieving that future as President of the United States."
"Right-wing courts have ruled that religious freedom laws allow corporations to deny employees birth control, but don’t protect tribes that object to dumping sewage water on sacred sites. Absurd. Congress should pass a new law protecting tribal religious interests in sacred sites."
"When tribal concerns have conflicted with corporate profits or resource extraction, tribes lose. This has to change. When I’m president, energy projects that impact Indian Country won’t proceed without consent. That means revoking Trump’s KeystoneXL and DAPL permits."
"In 2013, the Violence Against Women Act crucially recognized some criminal jurisdiction by Tribal Nations, and I support reauthorizing and building on it. But we need to go further and I support a full Oliphant fix."
Washington has refused to fully respect tribal sovereignty in criminal justice matters. This has deprived countless crime victims the opportunity to get justice. And it has fed the ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. This must change. #MMIW
"Funding critical programs for Indian Country isn't optional. It's required to fulfill the United States’ trust and treaty obligations. So @Deb4CongressNM and I have teamed up on writing a bill to ensure predictable, guaranteed funding to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples."
"Washington is failing Native communities, and it's time to fulfill our obligations to Tribal Nations. Today I’m announcing ideas to ensure that tribal sovereignty and our trust and treaty obligations are binding legal and moral principles—not just slogans."
"Last month, the FTC tweeted and advertised that the nearly 150 million Americans who had their data exposed in the @Equifax breach were eligible for $125 each in compensation.

Now they’re saying, “Just kidding!” I’m demanding answers."

Heartsick to hear that anti-LGBTQ+ violence increased during Pride Month. Hate and homophobia should have no place here in America. Now is the time to get in this fight for a country where LGBTQ+ Americans can live without fear.
You bet I do. Here it is:
"I’m humbled and grateful for your support, @DanielBiss! Welcome to @TeamWarren."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight for workers in this country, and it’s time for us to show whose side we’re on. All Democrats need to stand up and say—without dodging or weaving—we support AB 5 and back full employee status for gig workers."
"It was great meeting you, Tracy. Thank you for being in this fight!"
"First Disney acquired 21st Century Fox.

Now CBS and Viacom are merging. 

Consolidation raises serious concerns for consumers, employees, and the entire sector. The Department of Justice should be paying close attention."
It was inspiring to see @Hickenlooper’s commitment to bettering our country during his campaign. I’m looking forward to fighting alongside him as we work to elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020.
"Activists, organizers, and community leaders are fighting tirelessly to end gun violence in their communities. We need to build on that momentum to tackle this epidemic head on. From executive action to comprehensive legislation to ending the filibuster—I've got a plan for that."
"Israel doesn't advance its case as a tolerant democracy or unwavering US ally by barring elected members of Congress from visiting because of their political views. This would be a shameful, unprecedented move. I urge Israel’s government to allow @IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib entry."
"I'm heartsick for the Philadelphia officers and their loved ones, and grateful for the brave first responders helping people get to safety.

We don't have to live like this. We must pass gun reform laws to end the gun violence epidemic—now."
"The warning signs for another recession are flashing. We need to pay attention and act now, while we still have time to avert a downturn. I'm calling on Congress and regulators to take action before families lose big—again."
"I stand with airport catering workers at @DFWAirport and across the country who are fighting for a living wage. When workers fight, workers win—and we won’t stop making our voices heard until #1Job is enough."
Steve King must resign. His latest comment is a disgusting attack on victims of sexual assault. The people of #IA04 deserve better. We must work together to elect @JDScholten in 2020.
"Thank you to the @WorkingFamilies Party for coming by our campaign headquarters yesterday! I was proud to partner with you to fight for the @CFPB, and I'm proud to keep fighting alongside you for big structural change in 2020!"
"For decades, Washington has done the bidding of giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to American workers like Kim and Bella. They deserve a government that’s on their side.

As president, I’ll use every tool available to defend and create American jobs."
The Trump administration is making it easier to remove protections for endangered species. We have a moral responsibility to protect these vulnerable species and our environment. My administration will undo this disastrous move.
"My plan for a new farm economy tackles this ugly history and levels the playing field for farmers of color. As president, I’ll end the policies that have perpetuated this dispossession and strengthen oversight of USDA to root out discrimination for good."
"Farmers of color have experienced a long history of discrimination. From 1910 to 1997, Black farmers were stripped of 90% of their land—a staggering loss and a major contribution to the racial wealth gap."
One way we can break the NRA’s stranglehold on Congress? Eliminate the filibuster. Our country should no longer be held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists.
"""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.""

Our values are etched in stone on the Statue of Liberty. They will not be replaced. And I will fight for those values and for our immigrant communities."

"Student loan debt is crushing hardworking Americans like Danielle.

That’s why I’m calling for something truly transformational: Universal free public college and cancelation of student loan debt for 95% of Americans who carry it."
"Grateful for your support, Mike! We’re in this fight together."
"Cherith is an Okie educator who teaches AP English Literature. She chipped in to my campaign because she’s in this fight with me to end gun violence, and to fix our broken education and immigration systems. I’m deeply grateful for your support, Cherith!"
"Person by person, dollar by dollar, we can win with a 100% grassroots movement: No federal lobbyists, no fundraisers with mega-donors, no money from PACs of any kind.

Will you chip in now to keep up the momentum?"
"Everyone should be able to access high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care. But the Trump administration is trying to roll back important protections for trans Americans. Help fight back by leaving a comment for HHS in protest:"
Strawberries are in season and my grandson’s in town—that means strawberry shortcake!
"The Walmart heirs make $4 million an hour.

A new Walmart associate makes $11 an hour.

My two-cent wealth tax on families like the Waltons would help level the playing field for working families and rebuild the middle class."
"It was an honor to meet you, Chase! Keep dreaming big and fighting hard."
Got some lemonade at the @IowaStateFair!
"This is a big win for @GavinGrimmVA and trans Americans across the country. When we fight, we win—and we won’t stop fighting until all trans people can live without fear or discrimination."
"Trump’s #PublicCharge policy makes it harder for immigrants who rely on government services to get permanent legal status. Families shouldn't be forced to choose between staying in our country & having access to basic health care & housing. As president, I'd overturn this rule."
We’re going to win in 2020 by getting organized at the grassroots level—like at our house party in Des Moines on Sunday. Democracy starts in our backyards!
Ready to talk with @WorkingFamilies tomorrow about how we can rebuild the middle class and make our government work for the people.
"The people of Hong Kong are making clear that they will not tolerate repression, and their movement affirms: The power is with the people. They deserve our support and the support of the world."
"I’m grateful to be in this fight alongside you, @SophiaBush! We’re going to make our government responsive to the will of the people, not a handful of corrupt extremists."
"Two years ago, white supremacy left another ugly mark on our history in #Charlottesville. We won't forget—and we'll continue to fight hate wherever it appears."
Making plans!
I loved meeting Masada and her family! Motion sickness is no fun for anyone—mom or kid. It happens to the best of us.

I had a terrific time at the @IowaStateFair yesterday! What happens in 2020 is going to determine the direction of our country for generations to come—and Iowa is right at the heart of it. #ISF2019
"When I’m president, I will send Congress comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation and sign it into law within my first 100 days. And we will revisit that legislation every single year based on new data to continually reduce the number of gun deaths in America."
"Over fifty years, comprehensive safety measures reduced per-mile driving deaths by almost 80% and prevented 3.5 million automobile deaths. We have to do the same for gun deaths—and I have a plan for that."
"I was honored to join activists, organizers, and community leaders at today's #GunSenseForum. And I’m ready to fight alongside them for big, structural change to tackle our gun violence epidemic. Here’s how:"
"Hey there, @KamalaHarris! 👋"
"Increasing taxes on gun manufacturers will reduce gun and ammunition sales and bring in new federal revenue that we can use for both gun violence prevention and enforcement of existing gun laws. Together, we can hold gun manufacturers accountable."
"Thank you to everyone who came out to the Iowa State Fair to talk, share your concerns, and grab a selfie. I had a fantastic day!"
Fun night at the @IowaWingDing dinner! Grateful for the opportunity to talk about my plans to make our government work for the people of Iowa.
It's past time to turn our heartbreak and anger into action. We need to take power from the NRA and corrupt lawmakers and return it to the people.
"Thank you, @PeterMAmbler. Together we can end the gun violence epidemic and make our country safer for everyone."
"Mass shootings capture our attention, but they’re just the tip of the iceberg of gun violence in America. Every day, we lose one hundred Americans to gun violence, with countless more injured and traumatized. My plan makes big changes to address all kinds of gun violence."
"In just a few minutes, I’ll be at the #GunSenseForum talking about how we can address the gun violence epidemic head on. I hope you’ll tune in."
"The dialogue about gun violence in America is shifting, thanks to the work of activists, organizers, community leaders, and survivors. It's time to turn our heartbreak and anger into action, and take power from the NRA and corrupt lawmakers and return it to the people."
"And we'll revisit this legislation every year—adding new ideas and tweaking existing ones—to keep reducing the number of gun deaths in America. My budget will invest $100 million for DOJ and HHS to study gun violence, evaluate the reforms we pass, and suggest new ones."
"We have to chart a new path, and that starts with investing in evidence-based community violence intervention designed to stop gun violence before it occurs. As president, I’ll establish a grant program to invest in and pilot intervention programs at scale."
"Black and Latinx Americans have borne the brunt of the gun violence tragedy. But after being traumatized by gun violence, these communities have been doubly victimized by increased policing and strict sentencing laws."
"In addition to ending the special legal immunity gun manufacturers have now, Congress should hold manufacturers strictly liable for gun-related injuries and give victims of gun violence a private right of action to recover compensatory damages from manufacturers."
"This legislation will ensure that safe, responsible ownership is the standard for everyone who chooses to own a gun. We'll create a federal licensing system, require universal background checks, establish a real waiting period, and cap firearms purchases."
I will send Congress comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation and sign it into law within my first 100 days.
"My administration will also protect survivors of domestic abuse by closing the ""boyfriend loophole."" And we'll reverse the Trump administration's efforts to weaken gun safety, including rules that enabled 3-D printed guns and make it easier to create untraceable weapons."

"We'll require background checks for the vast majority of private gun sales, including at gun shows and online. We'll extend the existing requirements on reporting bulk gun sales. And we'll raise the minimum age for purchasing a gun."
"From the White House, I will take executive action to rein in an out-of-control gun industry. Gun manufacturers make billions by knowingly selling deadly products, and it’s time to hold gun dealers and manufacturers accountable for the violence promoted by these products."
"In 2017, almost 40,000 people died from guns in the U.S. My goal is to reduce that number by 80%. We’ll start with solutions we believe will work. We’ll update those solutions based on new research—and stop corrupt extremists from blocking action by ending the filibuster."
"It’s easy to despair when our government refuses to act. But we are not incapable of solving big problems. Over fifty years ago, we took big steps to make our cars safer and since then, we reduced per-mile driving deaths by almost 80% and prevented 3.5 million automobile deaths."
The statistics are horrifying. Our firearm homicide rate is 25x higher than other comparable countries. Our firearm suicide rate is nearly 10x higher. Women are 21x more likely to be shot to death—most killed by an intimate partner. 21 children and teenagers are shot every day.
"Gun violence is a public health crisis. That’s why I have a comprehensive gun violence prevention plan—a plan to make big, structural changes to end the NRA and corrupt lawmakers’ ability to block our government from defending the lives of our people."
"In America, you ought to have a chance to build a real future for yourself and your family. But in farming communities in Council Bluffs and across Iowa, that’s getting harder and harder. 

We must invest in our farmers and our farm communities."
"I’m proud to sign the #DownBallotPledge! When we fight, we win—and in 2020, we have a real shot to elect Democrats up and down the ballot and make the big, structural changes our country needs."
"I applaud the 5th Circuit's decision upholding the constitutionality of the Indian Child Welfare Act. ICWA has been crucial in protecting the best interests of Native children, their families, and their communities for over 40 years and must be protected."
"Fran’s home in Pacific Junction, Iowa was devastated by flooding earlier this year. As she showed me where you can still see the water line, I asked her why she thought this was happening. Her answer: Climate change. I agree, and I’m ready to take bold action to fight back."
"Watching this little girl cry out for her father is a punch in the gut. The Trump administration’s cruelty knows no end.

I want to be very clear here: Families belong together. And when I am president, they will be."
"Looking forward to participating in @MomsDemand and @Everytown’s presidential #GunSenseForum this Saturday in Iowa. I’m in this fight for our kids, for our communities, and for our futures."
"5 years ago Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Michael was unarmed yet he was shot 6 times. I stand with activists and organizers who continue the fight for justice for Michael. We must confront systemic racism and police violence head on."
"Voters shouldn’t have to worry about whether their ballot is vulnerable to hackers. We need state-of-the-art voting machines, ballots, and election security—and I’ve got a plan for that."
It’s true—I joined Snapchat! Can’t wait to continue to connect with our grassroots supporters.
Climate change is getting worse and is putting our families’ futures in jeopardy. We need to help American farmers use all the tools in their toolbox to fight climate change—before food shortages become a reality.
"I’m standing with @gunsdownamerica, @AMarch4OurLives, and @AFTunion as they rally this weekend to urge @Walmart to stop selling guns. I hope you’ll join them."
Companies that sell guns have a responsibility to the safety of their communities. @Walmart is one of the largest gun retailers in the world. The weapons they sell are killing their own customers and employees. No profit is worth those lives. Do the right thing—stop selling guns.
"Sometimes, companies recognize that they have an obligation to the lives, health, and safety of their communities. In 2014, for example, CVS voluntarily stopped selling tobacco products. Cigarette sales went down, and more smokers tried to quit. That's progress."
"When I first ran for Senate in 2012, my team and I drove from event to event in a bright blue used SUV. It was great—but I think driving across Iowa in this takes the cake!"
"We'll require background checks for the vast majority of private gun sales, including at gun shows and online. We'll extend the existing requirements on reporting bulk gun sales. And we'll raise the minimum age for purchasing a gun."

"5 years ago Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Michael was unarmed yet he was shot 6 times. I stand with activists and organizers who continue the fight for justice for Michael. We must confront systemic racism and police violence head on."
"Voters shouldn’t have to worry about whether their ballot is vulnerable to hackers. We need state-of-the-art voting machines, ballots, and election security—and I’ve got a plan for that."
It’s true—I joined Snapchat! Can’t wait to continue to connect with our grassroots supporters.
Climate change is getting worse and is putting our families’ futures in jeopardy. We need to help American farmers use all the tools in their toolbox to fight climate change—before food shortages become a reality.
"I’m standing with @gunsdownamerica, @AMarch4OurLives, and @AFTunion as they rally this weekend to urge @Walmart to stop selling guns. I hope you’ll join them."
Companies that sell guns have a responsibility to the safety of their communities. @Walmart is one of the largest gun retailers in the world. The weapons they sell are killing their own customers and employees. No profit is worth those lives. Do the right thing—stop selling guns.
"Sometimes, companies recognize that they have an obligation to the lives, health, and safety of their communities. In 2014, for example, CVS voluntarily stopped selling tobacco products. Cigarette sales went down, and more smokers tried to quit. That's progress."
"When I first ran for Senate in 2012, my team and I drove from event to event in a bright blue used SUV. It was great—but I think driving across Iowa in this takes the cake!"
"Congratulations, @AlphonsoDavid! Looking forward to fighting alongside you for a world where LGBTQ+ communities can live without fear or discrimination."
"My heart aches for Pebbles LaDime Doe, Kiki Fantroy, and their loved ones. The murder of Black trans women is a crisis that we must call out—and address head-on."
Today I was asked whether the president is a white supremacist. I said yes.
Here’s a statistic that Donald Trump and the Republicans should pay attention to: Our country is losing a football field’s worth of natural land every 30 seconds. We must make our public lands part of the climate solution—and I have a plan to do just that:
"Stopped for a quick drink at a lemonade stand in Harlan, Iowa. When life gives you lemons, make big structural change!"
We’re building a grassroots movement to save our environment and restore opportunity to every corner of this country.
"Yesterday, we stopped in Pacific Junction, Iowa, to see the damage caused by this year’s extreme floods. Climate change is real—and we’re already facing the consequences. We need to take action now."
"Thank you, Sarah! I’m grateful to have you in this fight. That’s how this is going to work: You, me, and this grassroots movement are all in this together."
"I'm grateful down to my toes for all the meaningful conversations we're having during our Iowa road trip. Thanks for coming out last night, Council Bluffs!"
"This is inhumane and will have devastating effects on the children that are left behind. Make no mistake: I'll keep fighting my heart out for our immigrant communities—and in a Warren administration, immigrant families will be able to live without fear."
"Just days after the massacre in El Paso, fueled by anti-immigrant rhetoric, the Trump administration carried out the largest ICE raid in more than 10 years—separating families and targeting communities of color."
This is alarming—but there is still time to avert the next economic crash. I've outlined a plan for how to do it. And we need to act now.
"Meanwhile, the potential shocks I identified are looming larger. Trump is escalating his incoherent tariff-by-tweet strategy against China. The chances of a no-deal Brexit have risen. No wonder markets are assessing a high risk of a potential recession."
New data confirmed other weaknesses too. New Q2 economic data showed slowing growth. There's a slowdown in construction jobs and manufacturing job hours declined.
We got more confirmation of my concern that middle class families are falling deep into debt trying to bridge the gap between rising household costs and stagnant incomes.
"Two weeks ago I warned about a coming economic downturn. Since then, we've already seen more signs that our economy is in precarious condition and that Trump's rhetoric and actions are pushing us closer to the brink."
"Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump won’t act—but we will. Together, we can stand up to the NRA and demand real gun reform to keep our communities safe."
I’m inspired by every activist making their voice heard in El Paso today. We are #ElPasoStrong—and ready to tackle gun violence and white supremacy head-on.
Amazon is using its monopoly in online sales to force companies to raise prices at its competitors like Walmart. That’s bad for families and another reason we need to #BreakUpBigTech.
"Let’s create a federal Office of Broadband Access, and invest $85 billion into making sure every home in America has a broadband connection. That means publicly-owned and operated networks—no giant telecom companies running away with taxpayer dollars."
"Congratulations, @AlphonsoDavid! Looking forward to fighting alongside you for a world where LGBTQ+ communities can live without fear or discrimination."

"Just like workers need a living wage, farmers need a fair price. It’s time to fix the failed policies that are squeezing our family farmers."
"Cyntoia Brown is finally free—but we can’t forget that she was denied justice for over 14 years. The words above the Supreme Court say ""Equal Justice Under Law."" We need to start acting like it, and that means standing up for survivors of sexual violence."
You heard it at the #AFSCMEForum first—I want a labor leader as my Labor Secretary.
I stand in solidarity with the people who protested Donald Trump’s racist rhetoric and inaction on gun violence yesterday. We must fight for #GunReformNow—and I believe we will win.
"Farms are being crushed by failed Washington policies and giant agribusinesses, and many rural communities lack access to health care and fast, reliable internet. Our rural communities are being cut off from opportunities to thrive, and I have a plan to fix it."
"I want Washington to work for communities all over the country—and make sure every community has the resources it needs to thrive. Together, we can make big improvements in the lives of rural Americans."
"Agriculture has become one of the biggest polluters in our economy, thanks to decades of failed policy. By paying farmers to fight climate change and investing in R&D we can tackle climate change."
"I have plans that will help bring affordable housing, child care, and accessible banking to rural communities. My new approach to trade policy will make sure we're keeping good jobs here in America and giving rural communities a voice in trade negotiations."
"A whole bunch of my other plans will help rural communities, too. My plan to cancel student loan debt and provide free public college will help young people build a future in rural communities, instead of driving them to cities to find a job that can pay down their debt."
"Here’s my new approach: Guaranteeing farmers a fair price—raising farm incomes and reducing taxpayer expenses. We'll pay farmers for sustainable farming that protects our environment and provide consumers with affordable, local food."
"Finally, I've got a plan to overhaul our country's failed approach to the farm economy. For decades, government policy has subsidized industrial agriculture at taxpayers' expense while driving environmentally unsustainable farming practices and starving farmers."
This ends when I’m president. I'll create a public option for broadband and make sure every home has affordable high-speed internet. I'll crack down on anti-competitive practices and appoint FCC Commissioners who'll restore net neutrality and provide open access to the internet.
"One of the best tools to expand access to health care—and unlock other economic opportunities—is high-speed internet. But big broadband companies exclude entire communities—especially tribal communities and communities of color—from fast, reliable internet access."
"I'll also tackle consolidation in health care. If a proposed merger is a first step to closing hospitals or slashing basic services, then a Warren administration will block it. And I'll invest more resources in community health centers and closing today’s rural doctor shortage."
"My plan starts with protecting access to health care in rural communities, which are rapidly losing access to basic services. That's why I support #MedicareForAll—and why I'll increase Medicare reimbursement rates to help rural hospitals stay afloat."
"Everyone should have the opportunity to build a good life wherever they live. But as giant corporations and Washington keep cutting off opportunities for huge parts of the country, the shot to succeed gets further out of reach for rural families. I've got a plan to fix that."
"I'm kicking off my Iowa road trip today! As we head into Iowa, I'm sharing my new plans to invest in rural communities. It's time to put their interests ahead of giant companies and Wall Street."
"Voting is a fundamental right, and we won't let racist politicians undermine it. On the 54th anniversary of the #VotingRightsAct, I’m re-committing to making it safer and easier for all Americans to vote. It’s part of my plan to strengthen our democracy:"
"I’ve answered over 530 audience questions this year, and the hardest to swallow was from a little boy named Owen in Michigan. He asked, “How will you keep kids safe at school?”

No child should have to go to school fearing for their lives. We must take action on gun violence—now."
"Two background check bills passed the House months ago. But Mitch McConnell is refusing to let the Senate vote on them.

.@JDScholten is a true fighter for working people and is ready to stand against the white supremacist propaganda that Steve King regularly spews. I’m certain that he can win in 2020. Let’s work together to elect JD and return the power to the people! #IA04
This is how we’ll end the gun violence epidemic: Taking real action to stop tragedies like the ones in El Paso and Dayton from ever happening again.
"No parent should have to think like this. I'm in this fight for you and your daughter, Elena."
And we need a president willing to take executive action herself. I'll do everything I can—and I'll lead the fight for gun legislation from the White House.
"Donald Trump is enabling white supremacy—and Republicans are enabling him. And when Congress and the American people have tried to fight the gun violence epidemic, @SenateMajLdr has put the NRA first. If we want action, we need to take back the Senate and end the filibuster."
"If we want to end gun violence, we need to tackle corruption in Washington head-on. 

Right now the gun manufacturers—the guys who hire all the lobbyists and make all the campaign contributions—are pulling all the strings. We must fight it together."
"Two background check bills have already passed the House. The Senate has an opportunity to pass them—but Mitch McConnell refuses to act. 

@SenateMajLdr, you must bring the Senate back into session to vote on this important legislation."
White supremacy is not a mental illness. We need to call it what it is: Domestic terrorism. And we need to call out Donald Trump for amplifying these deadly ideologies.
"Republicans won’t act—because gun lobbyists are signing their checks. We must take back the Senate in 2020.

Will you chip in to help elect Democrats to the Senate? Let’s build a grassroots movement to beat back the gun lobby and end gun violence."
"Make no mistake, tomorrow the @NRA will go back to doing the dirty work of gun manufacturers and blocking progress at every turn. @SenateMajLdr must call us back into session to vote on the two background check bills that have already passed the House."
"I just talked to @Kasie Hunt about how white nationalism is domestic terrorism. And as Donald Trump has made one ugly statement after another, we’ve seen it on the rise. White nationalists embrace him, and the Republicans enable him.

Enough."
I’ll be there. Grateful to be fighting alongside you to end this epidemic.
We need to call it out: Fox News is a hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists.
We must treat this like the public health crisis that it is. @SenMajLdr: Bring the Senate back from recess to vote on legislation to address the gun violence epidemic.
"In March, I was asked about the increase in hate crimes since the election of Donald Trump. I want to be very clear: White supremacists pose a threat to the United States like any other terrorist group—and we need to use the full force of the Justice Department to go after them."
"We need to call out white nationalism for what it is—domestic terrorism. It is a threat to the United States, and we've seen its devastating toll this weekend. And we need to call out the president himself for advancing racism and white supremacy."
We're waking up to the second mass shooting in as many days. I’m heartsick for the 29 people killed this weekend in El Paso and Dayton—and all the other lives we lose every day due to senseless gun violence. We need to take urgent action to end the gun violence epidemic.
"Gun violence happens at schools, at places of worship, at work, at malls, at movie theaters, at festivals, and at home.

Gun violence can claim dozens of lives at once—and its daily toll claims dozens.

We have a gun violence epidemic in this country. We need to act—now."
I’m so grateful that everyone on your team is safe and accounted for. My staff and I are mourning with you for your friends and neighbors.

We need an entirely new approach to trade that uses every tool in the toolbox to help American families. My trade plan focuses on investing in American workers & using our leverage to raise global standards so that we can compete on a level playing field.
"We absolutely must be tough on China, but this haphazard approach of tariff by tweet is hurting American farmers and consumers. There’s no coherent plan beyond more and more escalation."

"Finally, our approach to enforcing trade deals is driving down standards worldwide. We offer corporations fast and powerful methods to enforce the provisions that benefit them, but make it nearly impossible to enforce labor and environmental protections. It's time to change that."
I'll make combating climate change a key focus of our trade deals—and make sure America lives up to the same standards we hold other countries to. I'll require countries we negotiate trade deals with to comply with the Paris Climate accord and end fossil fuel subsidies.
I'll also go further to make sure our trade deals ensure consumer safety & protect America's family farms. And I'll fight to bring down the costs of prescription drugs here & around the world by supporting price controls & seeking out opportunities to reduce exclusivity periods.
"I'll establish a set of standards that countries must meet as a precondition for any trade agreement: covering labor rights, human rights, religious freedom, human trafficking, protecting the environment, currency practices, and combating tax evasion and bribery."
"For too long, we've made trade deals with countries with abysmal records on labor, environmental issues, and human rights. They get concrete access to the American market while we get vague commitments to do better—which we hardly enforce. This must end."
"Our trade negotiations give special access to corporate interests before the agreement is rushed through Congress. I'll end this undemocratic, corrupt practice and negotiate and approve trade deals through a transparent process that offers the public a real chance to shape them."
"My plan is a whole new approach to trade that will transform every aspect of our current process, from how we negotiate deals, to the negotiating objectives we pursue, to the way we enforce agreements. This isn’t about tough talk—it's about big, structural change."
"America has enormous leverage in trade negotiations. I won’t hand that leverage to corporations to boost their own profits—I’ll use it to create and defend good American jobs, raise wages, fight climate change, lower drug prices, and raise living standards worldwide."
"For decades, America’s trade policy has put the profits of big multinational corporations ahead of American workers, farmers, and the environment. I have a new approach: Trade on our terms and only when it benefits American families. Here's my plan."
"Yesterday, 4 people were killed and dozens more injured in senseless gun violence attacks in Gilroy and Brooklyn. One of the victims was a 6-year-old child. And these are just the few that made headlines. I’m heartsick. We have a gun violence epidemic. It’s our duty to act—now."
I won’t! I promise to fight for your family as hard as I fight for mine.
"That’s right.

Gottlieb’s trip through the revolving door—from head of the @US_FDA to a spot on @Pfizer’s board—is a huge conflict of interest. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, that would be illegal."
"From day one, Trump has made his disdain for the intelligence community clear. Our Director of National Intelligence should be above partisan politics, speak truth to power, and resist Trump's abuses of authority. John Ratcliffe doesn't fit that bill."
"Great meeting you, Molly!"
Our campaign is 100% grassroots funded. So I spend my time calling as many people as I can to thank them for chipping into this movement. I love making these calls—and I’m planning on making more soon. Donate now and you could be next!
"I could feel the energy the moment I stepped through the door. Thank you to the people of Bow for hosting a terrific #WinWithWarren house party! If you’re ready to get in this fight with me, find an event in your community:"
Our government should keep Americans safe—not allow private prisons to profit off of locking people up. Here’s how my plan to ban private prisons works.
"Woo-hoo, thanks for coming out today, New Hampshire! I'm grateful down to my toes that we got to talk about the big, structural change we're fighting for."
"Thank you so much for your letter, Wade. We’ll keep fighting the good fight, together."
"To get serious about climate change and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, we need to end Big Oil’s stranglehold on Washington. As president, I’ll eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and put a moratorium on new fossil fuel leases offshore or on public lands."
"Finally, our approach to enforcing trade deals is driving down standards worldwide. We offer corporations fast and powerful methods to enforce the provisions that benefit them, but make it nearly impossible to enforce labor and environmental protections. It's time to change that."
I'll make combating climate change a key focus of our trade deals—and make sure America lives up to the same standards we hold other countries to. I'll require countries we negotiate trade deals with to comply with the Paris Climate accord and end fossil fuel subsidies.
I'll also go further to make sure our trade deals ensure consumer safety & protect America's family farms. And I'll fight to bring down the costs of prescription drugs here & around the world by supporting price controls & seeking out opportunities to reduce exclusivity periods.
"I'll establish a set of standards that countries must meet as a precondition for any trade agreement: covering labor rights, human rights, religious freedom, human trafficking, protecting the environment, currency practices, and combating tax evasion and bribery."
"For too long, we've made trade deals with countries with abysmal records on labor, environmental issues, and human rights. They get concrete access to the American market while we get vague commitments to do better—which we hardly enforce. This must end."
"Our trade negotiations give special access to corporate interests before the agreement is rushed through Congress. I'll end this undemocratic, corrupt practice and negotiate and approve trade deals through a transparent process that offers the public a real chance to shape them."
"My plan is a whole new approach to trade that will transform every aspect of our current process, from how we negotiate deals, to the negotiating objectives we pursue, to the way we enforce agreements. This isn’t about tough talk—it's about big, structural change."
"America has enormous leverage in trade negotiations. I won’t hand that leverage to corporations to boost their own profits—I’ll use it to create and defend good American jobs, raise wages, fight climate change, lower drug prices, and raise living standards worldwide."
"For decades, America’s trade policy has put the profits of big multinational corporations ahead of American workers, farmers, and the environment. I have a new approach: Trade on our terms and only when it benefits American families. Here's my plan."
"Yesterday, 4 people were killed and dozens more injured in senseless gun violence attacks in Gilroy and Brooklyn. One of the victims was a 6-year-old child. And these are just the few that made headlines. I’m heartsick. We have a gun violence epidemic. It’s our duty to act—now."
I won’t! I promise to fight for your family as hard as I fight for mine.
"That’s right.

Gottlieb’s trip through the revolving door—from head of the @US_FDA to a spot on @Pfizer’s board—is a huge conflict of interest. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, that would be illegal."
"From day one, Trump has made his disdain for the intelligence community clear. Our Director of National Intelligence should be above partisan politics, speak truth to power, and resist Trump's abuses of authority. John Ratcliffe doesn't fit that bill."
"Great meeting you, Molly!"
Our campaign is 100% grassroots funded. So I spend my time calling as many people as I can to thank them for chipping into this movement. I love making these calls—and I’m planning on making more soon. Donate now and you could be next!

"First, we can reduce household debt by raising wages and bringing down household costs. My plans tackle both sides of this problem, from raising the minimum wage to $15 to canceling student debt and making housing more affordable:"
"The good news is that we have the chance to head off a crisis, just like we had the chance to head it off in 2008, if we take bold action now to address the underlying problems in our economy. Here's what we need to do:"
"Our country’s economic foundation is fragile, and a single shock could bring it all down. Trump's reckless behavior makes that shock more likely. Financial markets and experts agree: We face a serious risk of another recession by the end of 2021—maybe even by the end of 2020."
"Despite Donald Trump’s promises of a manufacturing “renaissance,” the country is now in a manufacturing recession. For the first time ever, the hourly wage for manufacturing workers has dropped below the national average."
"Corporations are deeply in debt and taking risky loans, spreading that risk throughout our financial system. These high-risk loans look a lot like pre-2008 sub-prime mortgages: poorly underwritten and with minimal protections, packaged up and sold to investors."
"I know it sounds stark, but here's what I see today: Families are taking on more debt than ever, thanks to a generation of stagnant wages and rising costs. Student debt has more than doubled since 2008. More than 30% of American adults have debts in collection right now."
"I warned about an economic crash years before the 2008 crisis, but the people in power wouldn’t listen. Now I’m seeing serious warning signs again—and I’m calling for action before another crisis costs America’s families their homes, jobs, and savings."
"I had a terrific time with Mike (our @TeamWarren “Grab a Beer* With Elizabeth” contest winner) and his wife, Linda, from Elma, New York! We had beer and iced tea at my house, then grabbed dinner down the street. Bruce had a lot of fun and Bailey got to meet his new friend!"

"Betsy DeVos is the worst education secretary we’ve ever had. We need someone who will actually fight for our students, which is why I’ve pledged to nominate a former public school teacher to lead @USEdGov in a Warren administration."
"The warning lights are flashing. Whether it’s this year or next year, the odds of another economic downturn are high. This time, though, we can head it off. Congress and regulators should act immediately."
"With an economy this vulnerable, we need to reduce the odds of the potential shocks that can send us into another downturn. That means Congress should eliminate the debt ceiling & the Trump administration should replace its trade-war-by-tweet with China with a coherent strategy."
"We need to strengthen manufacturing by investing in it instead of undercutting it. My Green Manufacturing plan will invest $2 trillion in American green research, manufacturing, and exporting over the next decade, creating more than a million new American jobs."
"Next, we have to tackle corporate debt. After the 2008 crisis, Congress created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor market risks. But the Trump-era FSOC is falling down on the job. The FSOC should meet to discuss these risks and announce a plan to address them."
"First, we can reduce household debt by raising wages and bringing down household costs. My plans tackle both sides of this problem, from raising the minimum wage to $15 to canceling student debt and making housing more affordable:"
"The good news is that we have the chance to head off a crisis, just like we had the chance to head it off in 2008, if we take bold action now to address the underlying problems in our economy. Here's what we need to do:"
"Our country’s economic foundation is fragile, and a single shock could bring it all down. Trump's reckless behavior makes that shock more likely. Financial markets and experts agree: We face a serious risk of another recession by the end of 2021—maybe even by the end of 2020."
"Despite Donald Trump’s promises of a manufacturing “renaissance,” the country is now in a manufacturing recession. For the first time ever, the hourly wage for manufacturing workers has dropped below the national average."
"Corporations are deeply in debt and taking risky loans, spreading that risk throughout our financial system. These high-risk loans look a lot like pre-2008 sub-prime mortgages: poorly underwritten and with minimal protections, packaged up and sold to investors."
"I know it sounds stark, but here's what I see today: Families are taking on more debt than ever, thanks to a generation of stagnant wages and rising costs. Student debt has more than doubled since 2008. More than 30% of American adults have debts in collection right now."
"I warned about an economic crash years before the 2008 crisis, but the people in power wouldn’t listen. Now I’m seeing serious warning signs again—and I’m calling for action before another crisis costs America’s families their homes, jobs, and savings."
"I had a terrific time with Mike (our @TeamWarren “Grab a Beer* With Elizabeth” contest winner) and his wife, Linda, from Elma, New York! We had beer and iced tea at my house, then grabbed dinner down the street. Bruce had a lot of fun and Bailey got to meet his new friend!"
Ricardo Rosselló must listen to the people of Puerto Rico and resign.
Cleaning up before meeting some new friends tonight!
"After the big banks crashed our economy, the @CFPB was the big, structural change our country needed. Now, the Trump administration is on a mission to destroy it. I’ll keep fighting for consumers—today, and as president of the United States."
Today the @CFPB turns 8! I helped President Obama create an agency that would protect consumers—and that’s exactly what happened. The CFPB has forced financial companies to return an estimated $12 billion to the people.
"It’s time to tackle Washington corruption head-on. And yes, I’ve got a plan for that!"
"But above all, it's time to end unnecessary detention. Read my full plan for a more humane and fair immigration reform here:"
"This is good news—but Chin should never have been held in solitary confinement. My plan for immigration reform would end solitary confinement, enforce strict standards for medical care, and provide extra layers of protection for LGBTQ+ people."
"If you made it big, you should have to put a little back in to help everyone else make it, too. My #UltraMillionaireTax on the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans would help level the playing field for everyone."
"I've been traveling across the country talking about the change I'm fighting for—which means I've been through a lot of airports. I'm grateful every day for these workers, and they deserve a wage that can keep their families out of poverty. I'm proud to join @unitehere's protest."
"The Apollo 11 mission is a perfect reminder that if we dream big enough, fight hard enough, and invest in American ingenuity, we can accomplish incredible things. In fact, we can protect our planet for generations to come."
"That's why I’ve proposed a Green Apollo Program to tackle climate change head on, including $400 billion in government funding over the next 10 years for clean energy research and development—more than 10 times what we invested in the last 10 years."
"President Kennedy knew that we didn’t have the technology to achieve this goal at first—and his commitment spurred a decade of scientific and technological mobilization leading up to the moon landing. To tackle climate change today, we need to make another bold commitment."
"Fifty years ago today, our country put Americans on the moon. At first it seemed impossible, but we got it done because our government made bold investments in science, innovation, and American workers."
"I'm proud to stand with @HopkinsMedicine RNs as they fight for a union with @NationalNurses. Hopkins management must respect their right to organize without interference, harassment, or intimidation. #UnionStrong"
"People ask me how I stay energized on the trail (I don’t drink coffee). Here’s the answer: Grassroots supporters like you! If you’re dreaming big, fighting hard, and ready to win in 2020, then chip in to my campaign. We can only do this together."
We need to build a lasting foundation for LGBTQ+ rights so everyone can feel safe to be who they are. I’m honored to work alongside @AshleeMPreston in this fight.
Zero. This is cruel and inhumane. America should not turn away good people fleeing from violence and suffering. A Warren administration will increase the number of refugees that we welcome into the United States.
"You're absolutely right, Charlotte. Your confidence and grace inspires me, and I promise I'll continue fighting every step of the way until every trans American can live their best lives, free of fear and discrimination."
I've been standing with the people of Puerto Rico in their protests against corruption and their governor’s behavior. The people have spoken—loud and clear: @RicardoRossello should resign.
Big Pharma and corporate greed are root causes of the opioid epidemic. That’s why I proposed the CARE Act with Rep. Elijah Cummings to hold drug executives accountable and invest in our communities so we can end this crisis.

"Thank you for a fantastic night, Sioux City. This is how we’re going to do it—together."
Eugene Scalia spent his career putting giant corporations over American workers. This should concern anyone who believes that the Department of Labor should protect workers’ rights—not corporate interests. The Senate must reject his nomination for Secretary of Labor.
"In just a few minutes, I’ll be live at @AARPadvocates’ presidential forum. Tune in to be part of our conversation:"
"For generations, our government’s redlining policies prevented Black families from owning a home—and the effects are still being felt today. My plan for fair housing confronts this racist legacy head on."
Let’s be real. Private equity firms are like vampires—bleeding companies dry and walking away enriched. My new plan reins in these monsters to save our economy.
"That’s right, Sara. We’re in this fight together."
I agree with Lori @LightfootForChi all the way. The Fair Workweek Ordinance would help level the playing field for working families in Chicago. Thank you for sharing your mother’s story!

"Thank you so much, Claire. I’m grateful for your time and your support!"
"For decades, Washington has lived by one rule: If it’s good for Wall Street, it’s good for the economy. Today in Sioux City, Iowa, I talked about my new plan to change that rule."
Wall Street is scared. That’s why the big banks are building a “political machine” to keep Washington in their vice grip. I’m fighting back—and I’ve got a new plan to end Wall Street’s stranglehold on our economy.
"Grateful for another chance to talk about our grassroots movement at @CNN’s Democratic presidential debate on July 30th. I’m fired up for big, structural change—let’s do this!"
"As I head back to Iowa today, I’m thinking about farmers who have faced extreme flooding and billions in damage to their communities this year. Climate change is real and it’s here. Here's just one of my plans to make a #GreenNewDeal a reality:"
"When I was a kid, a minimum-wage job could support a family of three. Today it won’t keep a mom and her baby out of poverty. I’m glad to see the House pass the #RaiseTheWageAct to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now the Senate must act."
I’m glad to see @AndreaSCousins elected as chair of @TheDLCC board! We’ll need her trailblazing leadership heading into 2020 as we work to elect Democrats up and down the ballot.
Thank you @SenGillibrand—I'm so proud to be fighting alongside you!
Students shouldn’t have to worry about going hungry. Our new bill will help the nearly one in three college students who are food insecure.

"Letting financial firms run wild is undermining our economy. I am done with Washington ignoring the evidence and acting as if boosting Wall Street helps families. It's time to stop the looting, boost wages, grow our economy, and rein in Wall Street."
"I’ve spent a lot of my career studying how financial firms make money by tricking and trapping families. And after I proposed a new federal agency to protect consumers, I spent nearly a year setting up the @CFPB and helping write new rules to crack down on financial scams."
"Finally, Wall Street sucks money away from companies that need it to grow. My Accountable Capitalism Act would end big companies catering to the short-term interests of Wall Street and let our companies focus on long-term growth and their obligations to workers."
"Too many families face a choice of paying a late fee on their bills, an overdraft fee to the bank, or a sky-high interest rate to a payday lender while waiting on checks. The government should adopt real-time payment technology so families don't have to wait for checks to clear."
"I’ve spent years advocating for postal banking—allowing the United States Postal Service to partner with local community banks and credit unions to provide access to low-cost, basic banking services. As President, I’ll make it happen by appointing people committed to the cause."
It's also time to push our financial system back to its core purpose—giving people a place to put their money & connecting savers with borrowers. Our system doesn’t serve a huge slice of the country: 25% of American households don’t have adequate access to a simple bank account.
And we need to end the system where bankers can make huge bonuses if risky bets pay off but lose nothing if they fail. I'll appoint regulators who will impose tough new rules to rein in banker pay.
"First, we should enact my 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, which rebuilds the wall between commercial and investment banks and ends taxpayer subsidies for excessive risk-taking and speculation."
"Next, my plan would address the incentives that fuel useless speculation that can make bankers rich but undermines the rest of the economy. Washington has encouraged this speculation with giveaways, subsidies, and lax rules. I want to end these practices immediately."
"My plan starts by ending this looting and fundamentally changing the industry. Private equity firms will only make money if the company succeeds. And if they make bad investments, they'll be held accountable instead of walking away with millions."
"Just look at the private equity industry. They buy companies and bleed them dry. And when the company fails, the Wall Street guys walk away with millions while workers are left holding the bag. It's legalized looting."
"Study after study shows that, past a certain point, a growing financial sector hurts the rest of the economy by extracting money from it. And America is way past that point."
"For decades, Washington has lived by a simple rule: If it’s good for Wall Street, it’s good for the economy. But it just isn’t true. Big banks are making record profits and handing out huge bonuses as average wages barely budge."
"Wall Street is looting the economy—and Washington is helping them do it. I’m tired of big financial firms padding their own pockets while the rest of the economy suffers, and that’s why I’ve got a plan to end it:"
"We must call out those who remain silent. We must initiate impeachment proceedings to hold him accountable. And we must build an unstoppable grassroots movement that resoundingly defeats not just Trump, but complicit Republicans everywhere."
"This president is desperate. Calling out his racism, xenophobia, and misogyny is imperative. But he’s trying to divide us and distract from his own crimes, and from his deeply unpopular agenda of letting the wealthy and well-connected rip off the country. We must do more."
"On #HIVPreventionDay, let’s recommit to HIV research and treatment, and work to ensure that everyone has access to PrEP, HIV testing, and other vital health care services."
Our fight for a federal minimum wage will not come at the cost of employment for Americans with disabilities. Creating a false choice between the two is cruel and ableist. Americans with disabilities are Americans deserving of equal pay and opportunity.

"It’s not equal justice when a kid with an ounce of pot can get thrown in jail, while a big bank executive who cheats and defrauds Americans can get a bonus. The words above the Supreme Court say ""Equal Justice Under Law""—we need to start acting like it."
This is an injustice. We have a responsibility to protect our citizens—and to hold police accountable when they fail. No one is safe in a country with a broken criminal justice system. My heart goes out to Eric Garner's family today.

I fully support Amazon workers' Prime Day strike. Their fight for safe and reliable jobs is another reminder that we must come together to hold big corporations accountable.
Will you sign my petition to make it clear that we won’t shy away from holding the Trump administration accountable for their abuses? We’re going to fight these human rights violations with everything we’ve got. And we won’t ever back down.
"When people come to our borders desperate—people whose lives have been turned upside down, people trying to build a better future—we need to treat them with humanity, and we need to follow the law."
"Trump may look the other way—but President Elizabeth Warren will not. I'll launch a task force in the Department of Justice to investigate the Trump administration’s criminal abuses at the border, and we’ll hold perpetrators accountable. Here’s the plan:"
"I’ve got a message for the Trump administration: When you physically abuse immigrants, sexually abuse immigrants, or refuse to supply immigrants with the medical care that they need, you break the law of the United States of America."
I always have a “Mr. Rogers moment” when I put on my sneaks.
Babies and toddlers belong with their families—full stop. The Trump administration is morally bankrupt and I’m fighting their cruelty every step of the way. #HereToStay
"It was great meeting you, Tom. Unions should be quick and easy to join—and we can’t win if we don’t fight."
"Let’s be clear about what this vile comment is: A racist and xenophobic attack on Democratic congresswomen. This *is* their country, regardless of whether or not Trump realizes it. They should be treated with respect. As president, I’ll make sure of it."
"I sure do! Conan, DM me and we'll get it sorted out."
"Thank you, Marielena. Grateful to be in the fight for a more humane immigration system alongside you."
"Immigrant families, working families, families on the ragged edge of the middle class—when I’m president, I promise to fight for your family as hard as I fight for mine. Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can to help our grassroots movement keep fighting?"
Grateful down to my toes for the opportunity to talk with and listen to this powerful group of activists.
"Trump has taken our immigration system to its most punitive extreme. In a Warren administration, we’ll right his wrongs. And we’ll start by holding those responsible for the abuses perpetrated against immigrants during the Trump Era accountable."
"Thank you, Graham! We’re going to do this together."
It was an honor to spend time with you and your niece this afternoon.
"Thank you, @Netroots_Nation! I’m fighting for the big, structural change our country needs to succeed—and that starts with growing our grassroots movement together."
"Donald Trump may be willing to look the other way while criminal abuses toward immigrants pile up, but make no mistake: President Elizabeth Warren will not. #NN19"

"Thank you for sharing your story, @J_Mac1422. Like you and so many other parents, I struggled to find high-quality, affordable child care for Amelia and Alex. It’s why I’ve got a plan for #UniversalChildCare."
"Yesterday in Milwaukee, I made it clear: Immigration makes America stronger—and I’ve got a plan to remake our broken immigration system from top to bottom."
My plan to reform the State Department would end the practice of auctioning off American diplomacy to the highest bidder. Trump may think a fat wallet qualifies someone to represent our country abroad—but I don’t.
"Wow—thank you, Milwaukee! It was wonderful talking with everyone who came out to our town hall last night. I’m grateful for every person, family, and community getting in this fight for big, structural change."
"Thank you for having me last night, @LULAC! We had a fantastic conversation about protecting the rights of our immigrant communities."
"After Patrick Pizzella lobbied against labor laws in the Northern Mariana Islands so that companies could run sweatshops, I opposed his nomination for Deputy Secretary of Labor. Picking him as Acting @USDOL Secretary is yet another slap in the face to American workers."
"It made me think about my family, too, how my mother would work her grocery list to squeeze out every last nickel. In that moment, I knew Bruce and I would be bound to each other forever. And when I proposed to him, he said yes. Happy anniversary, Bruce! I love you."
"One day at the grocery store soon after we first met, I saw Bruce gazing at the strawberry display. I said, “We can get some if you want!” He smiled, picked up a carton, and told me he was thinking about his family. “We didn’t eat things like fresh strawberries,” he explained."
"Grateful down to my toes to have you in this fight alongside me, @Liuba4Congress!"
I stand in solidarity with @Lights4Liberty activists around the world shining a light on the inhumane practices at our border. We must ban for-profit detention centers and treat immigrants with the dignity and respect they deserve.
"I’m deeply saddened to hear that Héctor Figueroa—a tireless fighter for workers and unions—has passed. Héctor’s leadership as president of @32BJSEIU deeply inspired me, and I’m honored to have known him."
I’m praying for New Orleans and its resilient people as they brace for major flooding from Tropical Storm #Barry. Climate change is an existential threat—and we must take action now.
Then we must go a step further: Universal free public college and the cancellation of student debt for 95% of Americans who carry it. My plan would fix the student loan debt crisis—and prevent another one from happening again.
"But under @BetsyDeVosED's watch, fewer than 1% of borrowers who applied to the program have had their loans forgiven.

I stand with @AFTunion in fighting back and making things right for these borrowers."
"When thousands of public servants were at risk of being denied federal student loan relief, I pushed back. I helped expand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program by $700M to help teachers, firefighters, and other Americans get the relief they earned."
Good.
"Thank you, Derrick. Looking forward to chatting with you soon!"
Grateful to be a part of the 110th annual @NAACP convention!
"My immigration reforms tackle Donald Trump’s cruel policies and our broken immigration system head-on. We need a rules-based system that is fair, humane, and reflects our values."
The Trump administration’s cruelty runs bone-deep. A Warren administration will not rip families apart to try and score political points.

Immigrants are woven into the fabric of our country—and they are #HereToStay.
"President Trump has weaponized deportation in ways that are costly, ineffective, and designed to maximize pain. It’s time to end this cruelty. Here’s my plan to do just that:"
"We need big, structural change in our immigration system. Today, I announced my plan for fair, humane immigration reform that reflects our values. Read the plan and join our fight:"
This ruling on #TitleX is part of a targeted attack on women with low incomes and women of color by right-wing ideologues. We must pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive health care. I have a plan for that:
"Necesitamos un cambio estructural: un sistema de inmigración justo que preserve nuestra seguridad, ayude a crecer nuestra economía y refleje nuestros valores."
"Trabajaré con el Congreso para aprobar una reforma de inmigración de gran alcance, pero también estoy lista para ejercer el poder ejecutivo si se niegan a actuar."
"No podemos enfrentar la migración hasta que no enfrentemos sus causas—pobreza, cambio climático, violencia e injusticia. Como presidenta, restauraré e incrementaré esfuerzos para enfrentar el crimen transnacional. Y mi administración protegerá a las personas que busquen asilo."
"Trabajaré para expandir la inmigración legal e implementaré acciones ejecutivas para proteger a los Dreamers y aquellos que han formado sus vidas en nuestro país, mientras trabajamos para crear una solución legislativa que asegure una ruta justa y asequible a la naturalización."
"Nuestras leyes y valores nos impulsan a ayudar a los que huyen de la violencia y la opresión. Como presidenta, rechazaré las políticas de exclusión basadas en raza, religión o nacionalidad. En mi primer día, revertiré la política racista de la prohibición de los musulmanes."
"Eliminaremos la expulsión rápida y proveeremos el debido proceso bajo la ley para inmigrantes enfrentando deportación, garantizando que tengan vistas en la corte y dándoles acceso a consultoría legal."
"Acabaré con la detención innecesaria, enfocando estos esfuerzos en personas que presenten un riesgo de fuga o riesgos a la seguridad de otros. Y, para prevenir abusos futuros en nuestro sistema de inmigración, mi administración establecerá cortes independientes de inmigración."
"Reduciré la detención de manera drástica. Separar a las familias y detener a los vulnerables es costoso, inhumano, y se ha comprobado que no tiene un efecto disuasivo."
Mi administración exigirá la rendición de cuentas por los abusos cometidos bajo la administración de Trump. Designaré un grupo de trabajo en el DOJ para investigar acusaciones graves y les daré autoridad independiente para que puedan presentar denuncias penales.
"Las agencias de inmigración deberían proteger a los estadounidenses y defender nuestras leyes, en vez de dedicarse a perseguir políticas punitivas y anti inmigratorias que afectan—mayormente—a las comunidades de color. Como presidenta, reconstruiré el CBP y ICE de pies a cabeza."
"Entrar al país sin autorización siempre ha sido una violación civil bajo la ley de inmigración, pero gracias a un ex senador segregacionista, también es una violación criminal. Esto es innecesario para la seguridad fronteriza y deberíamos eliminar esta prohibición criminal."
"Mi plan comienza por eliminar el cumplimiento de la ley de manera abusiva. Trump ha usado la deportación como un arma costosa, ineficaz y diseñada para maximizar el dolor. Como presidenta de los Estados Unidos, acabaré con esta crueldad."
"Los inmigrantes son nuestros vecinos, colegas y amigos. Son tan parte de EE.UU. como aquellas personas que han nacido en este país. Nuestro sistema de inmigración debería ser justo, humano y debería reflejar nuestros valores. Nuestros vecinos no deberían vivir con miedo."
Trump ha llevado nuestro sistema de inmigración al extremo más punitivo. Sus políticas racistas se basan en un sistema roto y una infraestructura del cumplimiento de la ley que es abusiva. Hoy anuncio mi plan para reformar nuestro sistema de inmigración.
"I’ll work with Congress to pass broad-reaching reform, but I’m also prepared to move forward with executive action if they refuse to act. We need big, structural change: A fair immigration system that preserves our security, grows our economy, and reflects our values."
"But we cannot fully address migration until we address its root causes—poverty, climate change, violence and injustice. As president, I’ll restore and increase aid and step up efforts to address transnational crime. And my administration will protect those seeking refuge here."

"Our laws and our values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. As president, I’ll reject exclusionary policies based on race, religion and nationality, and I’ll reverse Trump’s bigoted Muslim Ban on my first day in office."
"To prevent future abuses of our immigration system, my administration will establish independent immigration courts. We'll eliminate expedited removal and provide due process for immigrants facing deportation, guaranteeing hearings and providing access to counsel."
"Next, I’ll significantly reduce immigration detention. Separating families and detaining the vulnerable is expensive, inhumane, and has no proven deterrent effect. I’ll end unnecessary detention, detaining only those who pose a safety risk, and stop for-profit detention entirely."
And my administration will demand accountability for the abuse committed under the Trump administration. I'll set up a DOJ task force to investigate accusations of serious violations and give it independent authority to pursue any criminal allegations.
"Our immigration agencies should protect Americans and uphold the rule of law, not pursue punitive anti-immigrant policies that target communities of color. As president, I'll reshape CBP and ICE from top to bottom."
"Entering the country without authorization has always been a violation of civil immigration law, but thanks to a former segregationist senator, it’s also a criminal violation. This is totally unnecessary for border security, and we should repeal the criminal prohibition."
"My plan starts with eliminating abusive enforcement. Trump has weaponized deportation in ways that are costly, ineffective, and designed to maximize pain. As president, I will end this cruelty."
"Immigrants are our neighbors, our colleagues, and our friends—and every bit as much a part of America as those who were born in the United States. Our immigration system must be fair, humane, and reflect our values. Our neighbors shouldn’t have to live in fear."
"President Trump has taken our immigration system to its most punitive extreme, but his racist policies build on a broken system and an enforcement infrastructure already primed for abuse. Today, I'm announcing my plan to reform our immigration system."
"Like a lot of Americans, my life has had a lot of twists and turns. Here’s my story—from falling in love and dropping out of college, to chasing my dream of being a public school teacher."
"From the overflow to the front row, I’m so inspired by the energy in New Hampshire. Thankful for everyone who came out to our Peterborough town hall this week!"
"Let's call this what it really is: Exploitation for profit. We must put an end to for-profit immigration detention centers and private prisons, and I've got a plan to do just that:"
These stories are horrifying. Children are in danger. We need answers.
I believe in you. Persist!
"For a lot of candidates, “call time” means phoning millionaires and asking for big checks.

Not me. 

I spend my “call time” thanking supporters and talking with voters. Our campaign is a 100% grassroots-funded movement, fueled by the people."
We need to take bold action to attack climate change. I'm proud to support the #GreenNewDeal. I've also got plans to invest in clean energy tech and to stop drilling and promote renewables on public lands. This plan is another tool we can use to attack climate change.
"My Climate Risk Disclosure plan requires companies to publicly disclose both environmental & financial climate-related risks to their business. Investors are already divesting from fossil fuel companies, and this will push more investors to divest and transition to clean energy."
"Publicly traded companies have an obligation to share important information about their business. But right now they don't share much about how climate change might affect them, their customers, and their investors."

"Today, Republican lawmakers in VA ignored their responsibility to protect the people of their state from another mass shooting like the one in Virginia Beach. I stand behind leaders like @SheilaForVA who know what it takes to end this crisis."
"In this primary, we have a chance to build a 100% grassroots movement. Face to face, family by family, dollar by dollar, we’re gaining the momentum we’ll need come November 2020. Your contribution will make this movement stronger:"
The selfies are the best part! I’m grateful for every person who chips in a dollar here or an hour there to help grow this grassroots movement. This is how we’re going to win—together.
"The Democratic primary should not be decided by billionaires, whether they’re funding Super PACs or funding themselves. The strongest Democratic nominee in the general will have a coalition that’s powered by a grassroots movement."
"For generations, our federal government denied Black and Brown families the same kinds of homeownership subsidies available to white families. My housing plan tackles the legacy of racist redlining head-on."
"I opposed Secretary Acosta's nomination, and voted against his confirmation. The last few days have only highlighted how ethically compromised and unfit to serve he is. Acosta must resign—now."
".@AmyMcGrathKY is a real fighter for working families in Kentucky and across the country. She inspired us in 2018, and now she’s running for the U.S. Senate. Go Amy!"
"I’ve been to 23 states and Puerto Rico since launching this grassroots campaign—and later this week, Wisconsin will make 24! I hope I’ll see you in Milwaukee on Thursday."
No closed-door fundraisers. No D.C. lobbyists. No PACs of any kind. I’m incredibly grateful for every grassroots donor who is helping grow this campaign. Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can to keep up the momentum? I may even call to say thanks!
"At today’s town hall in Peterborough, we had a terrific conversation about how we can make our government and our economy actually work for the people of New Hampshire. Let’s do this together!"
"For every dollar white men made in 2017:

▪️ Black women made 61 cents
▪️ Native women made 58 cents
▪️ Latinas made 53 cents

"Thank you @EricSwalwell for your commitment to making gun reform front and center in this election. Gun violence is a public health crisis, and I’ll keep fighting alongside you for a safer future. The American people are lucky to have you in this fight."
"It was lovely chatting with you again this weekend at #EssenceFest, @AshleeMPreston! I’m grateful down to my toes to be fighting alongside you for big, structural change."
"I am humbled by the depth of grassroots commitment to our campaign. This is how we make our government and democracy work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. Thank you, and let’s keep at it."
I called for an investigation into Elliott Broidy's actions surrounding president Trump's inauguration last year. Now a real investigation is happening. This is exactly why I'm fighting to end corruption in Washington.
"It’s a long way to Election Day. But our fight starts here, with you."
Help build a grassroots operation across the country to return the power to the people and save our democracy. Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can right now to keep up the momentum? We can only do this together.
"They bring home the ratings, the revenue, and the wins. But even if they didn’t, the players of the @USWNT deserve equal pay."
"A nation is great when it lives its values. And right now, our nation has an immigration policy that is designed to maximize cruelty toward our immigrant communities. We need to change it."
"My mother’s minimum wage job at Sears saved our family after my daddy’s heart attack. In today’s America, it won’t keep a mama and baby out of poverty. We must raise the minimum wage to $15. Working families deserve living wages. #FightFor15"
"Today, Republican lawmakers in VA ignored their responsibility to protect the people of their state from another mass shooting like the one in Virginia Beach. I stand behind leaders like @SheilaForVA who know what it takes to end this crisis."
"In this primary, we have a chance to build a 100% grassroots movement. Face to face, family by family, dollar by dollar, we’re gaining the momentum we’ll need come November 2020. Your contribution will make this movement stronger:"
The selfies are the best part! I’m grateful for every person who chips in a dollar here or an hour there to help grow this grassroots movement. This is how we’re going to win—together.
"The Democratic primary should not be decided by billionaires, whether they’re funding Super PACs or funding themselves. The strongest Democratic nominee in the general will have a coalition that’s powered by a grassroots movement."
"For generations, our federal government denied Black and Brown families the same kinds of homeownership subsidies available to white families. My housing plan tackles the legacy of racist redlining head-on."
"I opposed Secretary Acosta's nomination, and voted against his confirmation. The last few days have only highlighted how ethically compromised and unfit to serve he is. Acosta must resign—now."
".@AmyMcGrathKY is a real fighter for working families in Kentucky and across the country. She inspired us in 2018, and now she’s running for the U.S. Senate. Go Amy!"
"I’ve been to 23 states and Puerto Rico since launching this grassroots campaign—and later this week, Wisconsin will make 24! I hope I’ll see you in Milwaukee on Thursday."
No closed-door fundraisers. No D.C. lobbyists. No PACs of any kind. I’m incredibly grateful for every grassroots donor who is helping grow this campaign. Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can to keep up the momentum? I may even call to say thanks!
"At today’s town hall in Peterborough, we had a terrific conversation about how we can make our government and our economy actually work for the people of New Hampshire. Let’s do this together!"
"For every dollar white men made in 2017:

▪️ Black women made 61 cents
▪️ Native women made 58 cents
▪️ Latinas made 53 cents

On day one of a Warren administration, I will take executive action to boost wages for women of color. Here’s how:"
"Thank you @EricSwalwell for your commitment to making gun reform front and center in this election. Gun violence is a public health crisis, and I’ll keep fighting alongside you for a safer future. The American people are lucky to have you in this fight."
"It was lovely chatting with you again this weekend at #EssenceFest, @AshleeMPreston! I’m grateful down to my toes to be fighting alongside you for big, structural change."
"I am humbled by the depth of grassroots commitment to our campaign. This is how we make our government and democracy work for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. Thank you, and let’s keep at it."
I called for an investigation into Elliott Broidy's actions surrounding president Trump's inauguration last year. Now a real investigation is happening. This is exactly why I'm fighting to end corruption in Washington.
"It’s a long way to Election Day. But our fight starts here, with you."
Help build a grassroots operation across the country to return the power to the people and save our democracy. Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can right now to keep up the momentum? We can only do this together.
"They bring home the ratings, the revenue, and the wins. But even if they didn’t, the players of the @USWNT deserve equal pay."

"Just about a year ago, Bruce brought home Bailey, and no matter how difficult my day’s been (or how many cushions Bailey’s chewed), he never fails to cheer me up. I’m so grateful to have this pup in my life!"
We all want a country where everyone—not just the wealthy—can take care of their families and participate in our democracy.
"Woo-hoo! Congratulations to the @USWNT on their World Cup win. Your persistence on and off the field inspires girls and women everywhere to dream big, fight hard, and win. #FIFAWWC #OneNationOneTeam"
"I loved getting the chance to talk in person, @Ashleyn1cole!"
"I’m grateful to have been a part of the 25th annual @EssenceFest! We need to use every tool in the toolbox to make our government and our economy work for communities of color, and I’m glad we had the opportunity to talk about that today. #EssenceFest"
Here’s what I would’ve said to a 25-year-old me.
"I’m running for president of the United States—and yeah, I’ve got a lot of plans. Thank you, @EssenceFest!"
"On day one of a Warren administration, I will take a series of executive actions to boost wages for women of color and open up new pathways to the leadership positions they deserve. #EssenceFest"
"Black women are paid less and are less likely to be able to afford basic human rights like health care, child care, and housing. It’s no accident: It’s the legacy of systemic discrimination. My new plan helps right these wrongs. #EssenceFest"
It was great meeting you too. Go Cougars!
"The experiences of women of color are not one-dimensional: Sexual orientation, gender identity, and ability all shape how a person’s work is valued in the workplace. Women of color work hard for their families. Our economy should work hard for them."
I’m grateful to be a part of the 25th annual @EssenceFest today. I’ll see you soon!
"My diploma from @UHouston gave me a second chance at my dream of becoming a public school teacher. What an honor to be back last night talking with voters and grassroots supporters. Thank you, Houston—you have a special place in my heart!"
I hope I see you there!
"I knew exactly what I wanted to do since I was in second grade: I wanted to be a public school teacher—and I had the opportunity to make that dream come true. Today, I’m in this fight for our educators, students, and #StrongPublicSchools. Thank you, @NEAToday and @Lily_NEA!"
America’s public school teachers are real heroes—I’m glad we got to talk today backstage at @NEAToday’s presidential forum. Tune in to watch my remarks live at the conference in just a few minutes.
Our government saddled a generation with $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. That’s why I’m calling for universal free college and cancelling student loan debt for more than 95% of Americans who have it. We must end the student debt crisis.
"Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education in our history. We need someone who will actually fight for students, not for giant corporations. So when @Liat_RO suggested that the next Secretary of Education should be a former public school teacher, I pledged to make it happen."
Looking forward to @NEAToday’s presidential forum today and the opportunity to talk about my plan to appoint a public school teacher as the next education secretary. Tune in!
"Black women are more likely to be breadwinners for their families, yet they are paid less and are less likely to be able to afford health care, child care, and housing. I'm proud to share my new plan to address this head on at #EssenceFest this weekend:"

"This is just the first step—but it’s a necessary one. It’s time to build an America that recognizes the role that women of color play in their families and in the economy, that fairly values their work, and that delivers equal opportunity for everyone."
"Finally, I will strengthen enforcement against systemic discrimination. I will direct federal agencies to target enforcement towards industries where we know women of color face higher rates of discrimination."
I will also make sure the senior ranks of the federal government look like America. My administration will ensure that federal agencies recruit women of color and develop leadership paths for them. The government should do better if it demands more from the private sector.
"First, I will have new requirements for federal contractors: companies with bad track records on equal pay and management diversity won’t get new contracts. No contractor will be permitted to use forced arbitration and non-compete clauses for low- and medium-wage workers."
"The government has helped perpetuate the systemic discrimination that has denied women of color equal opportunities, and it’s time to right those wrongs. I've got a plan to boost their wages, open up career advancement, and fight systemic discrimination."
"The gender pay gap hits women of color particularly hard. When future employers use salary history to make new offers, they trap women of color in lower wages. Black and Brown women are disproportionately mistreated at work. Their path to higher-level management jobs is rockier."
"Women of color face a steeper climb to provide financial security for their families because of systemic discrimination. On Day One of a Warren administration, I’ll take a series of executive actions to help boost their wages and leadership opportunities."
"On #IndependenceDay, I’m celebrating our democracy—and recommitting to protect it. Our elections should be as secure as Fort Knox. Instead, they’re less secure than an Amazon account. I have a plan to make voting easy and secure for everyone."
"Thank you, Nevada! Your energy inspires me."
It was great to see @sleslienv and meet the wonderful people at Mari Chuy’s Mexican Kitchen yesterday. Thanks for having me!
"Today we celebrate our country and recommit to the big, structural changes we need to make our government and our economy work for everyone—not just for those at the top. I’ll fight my heart out for that. Happy #IndependenceDay!"
Big Tech companies like Facebook hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers to help shape the rules in their favor and throw around their economic power to snuff out every potential competitor. That’s another reason why we need to #BreakUpBigTech.
Are you telling me that billionaires aren’t in favor of my being president of the United States? I’m shocked!
"It should be illegal for former U.S. Senator @DavidVitter to go from serving the American people one day to lobbying for Russian oligarchs the next. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, it would be."
"Talk about a conflict of interest: Former @US_FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb just joined the board of @Pfizer—a Big Pharma corporation he once regulated. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, that would be illegal."
"No, Jamie. Corporate greed and corruption in Washington are what’s really wrong with America. That’s what got your bank a no-strings-attached taxpayer bailout after the crash back in 2008, and it’s still rigging the system against working families today."
"The naysayers said it would be “too hard” to build the @CFPB. The naysayers said it would be “too hard” for a woman to win a Senate seat in Massachusetts. Now they say it’s “too hard” for a woman to win the presidency.

Here’s what I say to them:"
"It’s unacceptable that Black moms are dying from childbirth-related causes 3-4 times more than white moms. Black maternal mortality is a crisis, and institutional racism is the root cause of it. I’ve got a plan to address it head on:"
Running for president: That’s what women do.
I had a lovely time at our AAPI community conversation in Las Vegas today. Thank you for taking the time to chat with me!

"Thank you for the warm welcome, Nevada!"
I’m glad to see people in Massachusetts and across the country fighting for our immigrant communities today. I stand with you in solidarity all the way.
Sickening. Human beings are being herded like animals right now in our country. This goes against our American values. It’s cruel and it must end—now.
There’s still time to RSVP to our community conversation tonight in Nevada. I hope I’ll see you there!
"This kind of xenophobic fear-mongering is sick. In a Warren administration, immigrant communities will be able to live without fear or discrimination. I will fight for them every step of the way."
"When I’m president, I’ll make certain that every person—regardless of race, creed, or economic background—is paid a living wage so they can build a secure future for themselves and their families. That’s how we’ll make our economy work for working people."
"I’ve got a new plan to protect our democracy! We must:

🗳️ Make voting easy and convenient
🗳️ Stop racist voter suppression
🗳️ Secure our elections"
Arbitration lets giant banks like @JPMorgan get away with scamming customers out of money. CEO Jamie Dimon should be working to protect consumers—but all he cares about is making a profit off of them. No more.
Our national security institutions should reflect the diversity of the country they serve and represent. I was proud to sign the #5050in2020 Pledge for Gender Parity.
"My affordable housing plan would:

🏠 Reduce rental costs by 10% over the next 10 years
🏠 Create 1.5 million new jobs
🏠 Build millions of new housing units"
"Rising housing costs have Americans in a vice grip, and Nevadans are among the hardest-hit. One of the root causes of the problem? A severe lack of affordable housing supply, and state and local land-use rules that needlessly drive up housing costs."
These racist and sexist comments are completely unacceptable. We need answers—and the @CBP agents involved must be held accountable.
"I’m grateful to have you in this fight, Joan."
"Thank you for the support, Wayne!"
Go for it.
"Through a toxic combination of malice and neglect, Donald Trump has declared war on the @StateDept. So I came up with a new plan to rebuild it."
"Thank you, Tom! We need bold and energetic diplomacy to make the world a little safer and more secure."
I’m grateful to have @ItsDShawna on our team. Her voice is powerful and inspires me to keep fighting hard.
"I’m fighting my heart out to build an economy that works for working families in our country. Thank you, @WorkingFamilies."
Bailey loves the morning air!

"Thank you, Caleb. I’m grateful for your support."
"Ha, I love it! Thanks for having faith in me."
Lots of candidates spend time on the phone with millionaires asking for checks. Not me. I’m spending my time talking with voters & thanking grassroots donors. I love hearing why people get in the fight. Will you chip in before our FEC deadline at midnight?
"I’m so inspired by you, Lisa. Grateful down to my bones to have you in this fight. Together, we can end the gun violence epidemic in our country."
"It was great to talk with you, Mia! I’m so grateful to have you in this fight."
"Keep persisting, @SenatorMuth."
"Yes, I do! I’m also fighting to:
✔ Ban assault weapons.
✔ Prevent domestic abusers from legally obtaining guns.
✔ End the gun show loophole."
I’m relying on grassroots donors like Nell to fuel this campaign.
"We’ve got an FEC deadline at midnight tonight—can you chip in whatever you can to our campaign? We’re building a grassroots operation across the country to return the power to the people, and we can only do it together."
I had a little time in the car to call grassroots donors like Ada.
"I’m not doing fundraisers with bazillionaires. I’m counting on grassroots support to fuel this campaign. Our big FEC deadline is at midnight, and every little bit helps. Chip in before tonight."
"Our President shouldn’t be squandering American influence on photo ops and exchanging love letters with a ruthless dictator. Instead, we should be dealing with North Korea through principled diplomacy that promotes US security, defends our allies, and upholds human rights."
Don’t worry—Bailey got a belly rub!
I just called some grassroots donors who gave today to tell them I’m grateful down to my toes for them. Keep it up—our FEC fundraising deadline is tomorrow at midnight.
"As president I’ll fight for you as hard as I fight for my own family. We’re powering our campaign without PACs or fancy fundraisers, just person to person—one small-dollar donation at a time. Will you chip in to my campaign before Sunday’s FEC deadline?"
"The photo line is always my favorite part of our events—and last night I took my 35,000th selfie!"
"Our fight is a righteous fight. And in a righteous fight, we fight until we win. #RPCCONV2019"
"I’m on my way back to Boston tonight. First, I’m going to walk Bailey. Then, I’m going to call a few grassroots donors who give this afternoon. Reply to this tweet and let me know that you've donated—and hopefully I'll get to chat with you tonight!"
.@RevJJackson and @RPCoalition are on the front lines for racial and economic justice in our country. I’m grateful to be a part of the #RPCCONV2019.
The attacks against @KamalaHarris are racist and ugly. We all have an obligation to speak out and say so. And it’s within the power and obligation of tech companies to stop these vile lies dead in their tracks.

"Every girl should grow up knowing that they can fight from the heart and win. If you agree it’s time for a woman president to make big, structural change, chip in $3 or whatever you can before our big June FEC deadline."
"Our country faces a housing crisis that disproportionately affects Black and Brown Americans. @HUDGov must address this—not just in the policies it pursues, but in the people it hires. Blankenstein's racist writings disqualify him from working there."
"Our kids shouldn’t have to go to school every day fearing for their lives. I’m fighting for common-sense gun reform, including banning assault weapons, preventing domestic abusers from legally obtaining guns, and ending the gun show loophole."
We need to fight for immigrant families and stop Donald Trump’s racist policies—and we can only do it together.
"Dream big, fight hard, and climb high, Ashli!"
Disgusting. My democracy plan would re-enfranchise those who have served their time and left prison—and prevent states like Florida from overriding their rights with Jim Crow-era nonsense.
"Our campaign is 100% powered by the people: Grassroots supporters who chip in whatever they can to dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020. Will you chip in $3 and join the fight? I might call you to say thanks!"
"Fifty years ago at #Stonewall, LGBTQ+ rights activists knew it wouldn’t be easy. But they also knew what was at stake. They kept going and they changed the course of history. Today, we recommit to fighting for LGBTQ+ equality. #Stonewall50"
I’m glad to see Kansas take this necessary step and recognize trans Americans for who they are. The rest of the country should do the same.
"As the Supreme Court prepares to take on the #DACA case, I want to make something clear: Immigrant youth are #HereToStay and I will fight my heart out to protect Dreamers."
"I don’t spend my time at fancy closed-door fundraisers trading favors for money, and I’ll appoint only the most qualified person for the job. In a Warren administration, I pledge not to give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers. Period."
Trump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons. He's appointed political cronies to nearly half the available ambassadorial positions. He may think a fat wallet and a big campaign check qualifies someone to represent our country abroad. I don't.
"To do this, we need to recruit a new generation of foreign service officers and retain talented officers. I’ll also significantly expand the pool of diplomatic talent. Today’s foreign service is 79% white and 65% male. Our foreign service must reflect the diversity of the U.S."
"Our foreign policy should not be run out of the Pentagon. Under a Warren administration, it won’t be. So I’ll start by doubling the size of the foreign service and opening new diplomatic posts in underserved areas to broaden U.S. diplomatic presence."
"The Pentagon is nearly 40 times bigger than the State Department—we employ more people in military grocery stores than we do foreign service officers. Our underinvestment in diplomacy causes our leaders to default to military action, instead of treating it as a last resort."
Senior career officials at the State Department have been pushed out & others have resigned in protest. We've lost 60% of our career ambassadors & 20% of our most experienced civil servants. Too often they've been replaced with totally unqualified campaign donors & Trump cronies.
"To take a meaningful leadership position in the world, protect our interests, and avoid conflicts, we need world-class diplomats. But through a toxic combination of malice and neglect, Donald Trump has declared war on the State Department."
The practice of auctioning off American diplomacy to the highest bidder must end. I'm pledging to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors—and I call on everyone running for President to do the same. Read my full plan:
"I’m in this fight because I believe that we can make our government, our economy, and our country work not just for those at the top—but for every working family in America. Thank you, Chicago!"
"In just a few minutes, I’ll be live with @RevJJackson at the @RPCoalition to talk about why I’m in this race. Tune in! #RPCConv2019"
"Every girl should grow up knowing that they can fight from the heart and win. If you agree it’s time for a woman president to make big, structural change, chip in $3 or whatever you can before our big June FEC deadline."
"Our country faces a housing crisis that disproportionately affects Black and Brown Americans. @HUDGov must address this—not just in the policies it pursues, but in the people it hires. Blankenstein's racist writings disqualify him from working there."
"Our kids shouldn’t have to go to school every day fearing for their lives. I’m fighting for common-sense gun reform, including banning assault weapons, preventing domestic abusers from legally obtaining guns, and ending the gun show loophole."
We need to fight for immigrant families and stop Donald Trump’s racist policies—and we can only do it together.
"Dream big, fight hard, and climb high, Ashli!"
Disgusting. My democracy plan would re-enfranchise those who have served their time and left prison—and prevent states like Florida from overriding their rights with Jim Crow-era nonsense.
"Our campaign is 100% powered by the people: Grassroots supporters who chip in whatever they can to dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020. Will you chip in $3 and join the fight? I might call you to say thanks!"
"Fifty years ago at #Stonewall, LGBTQ+ rights activists knew it wouldn’t be easy. But they also knew what was at stake. They kept going and they changed the course of history. Today, we recommit to fighting for LGBTQ+ equality. #Stonewall50"
I’m glad to see Kansas take this necessary step and recognize trans Americans for who they are. The rest of the country should do the same.
"As the Supreme Court prepares to take on the #DACA case, I want to make something clear: Immigrant youth are #HereToStay and I will fight my heart out to protect Dreamers."
"I don’t spend my time at fancy closed-door fundraisers trading favors for money, and I’ll appoint only the most qualified person for the job. In a Warren administration, I pledge not to give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers. Period."

"Next, my administration would conduct a second Census—without any questions about citizenship—to replace Trump's tainted Census in advance of the 2022 midterm elections. And I would have an aggressive, well-funded outreach campaign to reach historically undercounted communities."
"Here's how this would work. First, I would immediately direct all executive agencies to ignore the tainted Census data until a new Census is complete. States receive nearly $600 billion per year from 16 programs tied to Census data, & we won't allow a tainted Census to skew that."

"Next, we'll establish federal standards to ensure everyone can vote, including mandating automatic and same-day registration, early voting, and vote by mail. No more arbitrary voter purges, registration issues, or gerrymandering. We'll make Election Day a national holiday."
"I'll start by making sure federal elections get state-of-the-art machines, ballots, and security. We'll replace every voting machine in the country with state-of-the-art equipment and require adoption of a uniform federal ballot. And we'll make sure those systems are secure."
"We need a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote. But we can also take action now. The federal government has the power to regulate federal elections, secure our democracy, and put a stop to racist voter suppression."
Our elections are less secure than your Amazon account. They're under-resourced and undermined by partisan and racist officials who try to stop people from exercising their right to vote. We need to protect our democracy—and I’ve got a plan for that:
"We have a plan for #UniversalChildCare—and a bill to make it happen. I’m glad we’re in this fight together, @Deb4CongressNM!"
"Our laws should reflect our values. A two-cent tax on the wealthiest 75,000 fortunes will help rebuild the middle class and give every family a shot at the American dream."
"Donald Trump’s cruel threats of ICE raids are fear-mongering of the worst kind. In a Warren administration, we’ll protect immigrant families, fix our broken immigration system, and treat immigrant communities with dignity."
"Private immigration detention centers are exploitation for profit, and I’m glad to see Illinois ban them. My plan to end private prisons would require the rest of the country to do the same."
"My friend and colleague, Senator @JeanneShaheen, is a champion for working families in New Hampshire. Today a Republican opponent announced he’s running against Jeanne in 2020. We re-elected Jeanne in 2014, and we’ll do it again. Let’s help her win:"
"I saw the same thing at a @CBP processing center in McAllen, TX. I'll never forget listening to traumatized moms and children begging to be reunited. Let me make this clear: I'll never stop fighting Trump's cruel immigration policies."
"This week marks a year since I visited the Port Isabel Reunification Center in Los Fresnos, TX to find out what was really happening to immigrant families ripped apart at our border. I saw right away: It wasn’t a unification center—it was a prison."
"I agree with @JulianCastro: We shouldn't criminalize families trying to build a better future. We need comprehensive immigration reform that's in line with our values and creates a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including our DREAMers."
Queens: I hope you make your voices heard today and vote for @CabanForQueens if you haven’t already! Polls are open until 9:00 PM ET.
I stand with the hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow. The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for.
"Amazon has too much power. Under my plan to #BreakUpBigTech, entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against tech giants."
"My #UltraMillionaireTax is a two-cent tax on the 75,000 biggest fortunes in the country. We’d use it to pay for #UniversalChildCare, student loan debt relief, free public college, and a lot more. Here’s how it works."
The Trump administration’s treatment of the people of Puerto Rico continues to be a complete failure. Our government needs to follow through and provide the aid that is rightfully owed to the island immediately.
"It’s time to make voting easy and convenient, stop racist voter suppression, and secure our elections. I've got a plan to protect our democracy."

"People are dying at our border: Moms, babies, families sacrificing everything. We need to fix the Trump administration’s hateful immigration policies that treat immigrants like animals. Immigrant families belong together and deserve to be treated with respect."
"The cost of child care held me back until my Aunt Bee stepped in to help take care of Alex and Amelia. Today, it’s holding Amber and her family back. Every family should have access to high-quality, affordable child care. #UniversalChildCare"
"Together we can rebuild the middle class and make our economy work for the people—and I’ve got plans to actually make it happen. Will you chip in $3 to help build our grassroots operation across the country? Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win."
The 8 Mile Wall was built in the 1940s to separate Black families from white families. It’s a powerful reminder that Black Americans still feel the impact of generations of racist federal laws—and a reminder that our government needs to make it right.
"When workers fight, workers win."
"Our criminal justice system is broken—and race is right at the center of what's wrong. Black Americans are more likely to be arrested, wrongfully convicted, and serve longer sentences than white Americans. It’s time to end mass incarceration."
This is an attempt to block the young people at @IowaStateU from voting and making their voices heard. The HD46 special election should be held on a different Tuesday.
"I was glad to celebrate with you, and I’m proud to fight alongside you for reproductive justice!"

It wasn’t until marriage equality became law that gay & lesbian couples could jointly file tax returns—so they paid more in taxes. Our government owes them more than $50M for the years our discriminatory tax code left them out. We must right these wrongs.
"Twenty years ago, SCOTUS made a landmark decision in #Olmstead v. L.C.: All people have a right to live a life of dignity and independence. Let’s recommit to fighting to see this promise truly fulfilled for the disability community."
"Thank you @PPact for having me at today's #WeDecide Forum. It's time to go on the offense to protect #RoeVWade—and, in a Warren administration, we will defend and expand access to reproductive health care for everyone."
"Thank you, @SenGillibrand!"
I had a fabulous time at the @scdp convention! This election is about one fundamental question: Who does this government work for? Right now it's working great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. I'm in this fight because I want to make government work for all of us.
"Grateful for everyone who came out to the #ClyburnFishFry last night—I had a fantastic time. Thank you for welcoming us to South Carolina, Rep. Clyburn!"
"I’m so glad you listened! Bodie is adorable, and I know you two will be a great team."
"Fun fact: Meryl Streep and I share a birthday down to the year. (One of us has won multiple Oscars. Hint: It was definitely not me.) Happy birthday, Meryl!"
Thank you all so much! I couldn’t think of a better way to spend my birthday than by being out on the trail with all of you.

"Happy #NationalSelfieDay! Want to grab a drink soon with Bruce and me? Make a donation of any amount and you’ll automatically be entered for the chance to win a trip to meet us. Of course, Bailey will be there too."
"Welcome to the fight, Ella! I can tell she’s already dreaming big (and napping hard)."
Extremist Republicans are afraid of young people and communities of color making their voices heard. It should be safe and easy to vote—that’s why I’m fighting for a constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to vote and to have that vote counted.
"I do! My latest plan would ban all private prisons & detention facilities and stop companies from charging incarcerated & detained people for essential services, so we can finally put an end to private profiteering off of cruelty. Read all about it here:"
.@NALEO is a powerful advocate for the Latino community and for making sure everyone’s voice is heard. Deeply grateful for our conversation this morning at #NALEOMiami!
"Deporting hundreds of families—separating more children from their parents in the process—is inhumane. Our immigration policies should reflect America's values, not betray them. My administration will defend and protect immigrants and their families."
"We need to face the systemic problems in our immigration system by providing a pathway to citizenship, protecting our #DREAMERs, and keeping families together. My new plan to shut down private prisons and detention facilities is a step in that direction. #NALEOMiami"
It's not enough to say that we don't want conflict—we must make one less likely. Congress must make clear that war with Iran is not authorized. We should work with our allies to deescalate tensions and create space for diplomacy. We can't afford another forever war.
"When it comes to the future of our country, it’s not a question of more government or less government. It’s about who government works for.

In a Warren administration, our government will work for the people."
"In just a few minutes, I’ll be on the stage at #NALEOMiami. I hope you’ll tune in!"
"Washington hands billions to corporations profiting off of inhumane detention and incarceration policies while ignoring the families that are destroyed. It's corruption, plain and simple. Incarcerating and detaining millions for profit doesn’t keep us safe. We must do better."
"Finally, I'll hold contractors accountable by expanding oversight, transparency and enforcement. It’s time to shine sunlight on the black box of private services that receive taxpayer dollars."
"Next, I'll prohibit contractors from charging service fees for essential services, like phone calls, bank transfers, and health care. Companies shouldn’t be able to treat incarcerated individuals as captive profit centers."
"First, I'll end all contracts between the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service and private detention providers. There should be no place in America for profiting off of putting more people behind bars or in detention."
"The government has a basic responsibility to keep the people in its care safe—not to use their punishment and detention as an opportunity for profit. As president, I'll ban all private prisons and detention facilities:"
"Our criminal and immigration systems are tearing apart communities of color and devastating the poor, including children. Women—especially women of color—are particularly saddled with the financial burden."
And the exploitation doesn’t end when people leave these facilities. For-profit supervision companies (which are often run by the same private prison corporations) get rich by charging outrageous fees for monitoring and supervision services like ankle monitors.
The companies running prisons and detention centers regularly sacrifice safety to boost their bottom line. Private contractors in both public and private centers regularly cut corners to maximize margins and come up with schemes to make millions off of incarcerated people.
"The private prison population has grown rapidly since 2000. And with Donald Trump in the White House, private prison companies saw an opportunity to make millions off of his cruel immigration policies. Today, 73% of detained immigrants are held in private detention facilities."

Donald Trump promised to bring our troops home. Instead he has pulled out of a deal that was working and instigated another unnecessary conflict. There is no justification for further escalating this crisis—we need to step back from the brink of war.
Here's my big idea: I want to cancel student loan debt and provide universal free college. And we can pay for it all with my Ultra-Millionaire Tax.
"This is what happens when the president of the United States picks a former big coal lobbyist to lead the @EPA. I’ve got not one but two plans to ensure that, in a Warren administration, we’ll make big, structural changes to protect our environment."
We’re ready to fight this with all we’ve got.
This is more than just a bad ruling—it’s condoning an ugly attack targeted at women with low incomes and women of color. We’ll fight this.
CA’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights will help thousands of students. I'll keep fighting to go a step further: Making public college free for all and canceling student debt for 95% of Americans who have it.
"I already introduced the most sweeping plan since Watergate to root out corruption. And when it comes to national security, I went even further: A bill that would slam the revolving door between giant contractors and the Pentagon. Read more about it here:"
Donald Trump named a former top @Raytheon executive to replace a former @Boeing executive at @DeptOfDefense. We need to call this out for what it is: A transition of power at the Pentagon from one huge defense contractor to another. #EndCorruptionNow
"Thanks for fighting the good fight every day, Shannon. Together, we will end the gun violence epidemic in America."
"Trump provoked this crisis, and his reckless foreign policy by tweet will only worsen it. I've co-sponsored legislation to prohibit a war with Iran. We need to de-escalate tensions—not let the war hawks in this administration drag us into conflict. #NoWarWithIran"
This @UN investigation makes it clear: The Saudi Arabian government deliberately planned to murder @WashingtonPost journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He and his family deserve justice—but Donald Trump has done nothing to hold the Saudis accountable.
"I'm glad to see the Oklahoma Supreme Court has upheld a petition allowing the people to vote on Medicaid expansion. Health care is a basic human right, and all Okies should be able to access health care."
"A few months ago I met @Liat_RO, a public school science teacher and activist, at an organizing event in Brooklyn, NY. Liat gave me a great idea: The next Secretary of Education should be a former public school teacher. I agreed—and pledged to make it happen."
"I’m glad to introduce the Refund Equality Act in the Senate. Our bill ensures legally-married, same-sex couples can claim the tax refunds they earned, but were denied before marriage equality was the law of the land."
"I’ve got a plan:

✔ For Universal Child Care
✔ To break up Big Tech
✔ For student debt cancellation and free public college

And I’m just getting started! Donate $3 to help me keep the momentum going and meet our FEC fundraising deadline."
America needs to face the things we’ve done wrong and take steps towards making it right. My housing plan creates a first-of-its-kind down-payment assistance program to help Black and Brown families living in formerly redlined neighborhoods buy a home.
"On #Juneteenth, I’m thinking about how our country needs big, structural change to confront the oppression that Black Americans still face today. Black lives matter, Black citizens matter, Black families matter."
Our country must confront the impact that generations of slavery and racist policies still have on Black Americans. I support legislation to study and develop plans for reparations.
"It’s long past time to bring our troops home, and Congress should always have a vigorous and very public debate before sending our troops into harm's way. I support @BLeeForCongress's amendment to repeal the current AUMF and help #EndForeverWar."

"Right now, the average cost of child care for one child can take up to 36% of a family’s total income. My plan for #UniversalChildCare would make child care free for millions of families and affordable for everyone."
This is exactly right. Congress should pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive health care for everyone.
Facebook has too much power and a terrible track record when it comes to protecting our private information. We need to hold them accountable—not give them the chance to access even more user data. #BreakUpBigTech
"Woo-hoo! I’m deeply grateful that you’re part of this fight. One by one, we’re going to return the power to the people and win in 2020. #NVertheless"
"I’m proud to endorse Tiffany Cabán for Queens DA in New York. @CabanForQueens will fight for working families and work to end mass incarceration. Make sure you get out and vote for Tiffany next Tuesday, June 25th. In the meantime, head to   to volunteer!"
We need the people making investment decisions to look like the rest of America. That’s why I have a new plan: A Small Business Equity Fund to help close the startup capital gap for entrepreneurs of color.
"Juneteenth isn’t just about celebrating the end of slavery in Texas. It’s a necessary reminder that 154 years later, Black Americans still feel the harsh reality that the fight for racial equality in our country is far from over. I’m in that fight all the way."
"Donald Trump’s treatment of those seeking a better life in our country is inhumane. Make no mistake: In a Warren administration, we will defend and protect immigrants and their families."
"#UniversalChildCare is personal for me. I struggled to find care for my babies—until my Aunt Bee stepped in. Not everyone is lucky enough to have an Aunt Bee, and this plan is for them. Try my calculator to see how much you'd save under my plan."
"I’ve got a plan—and now a bill—for #UniversalChildCare. Today, Rep. @Deb4CongressNM and I introduced a new proposal that would make high-quality, affordable child care a reality for every family in America."
"At @UniteThePoor’s #PPCMoralCongress yesterday, I talked with @RevDrBarber and Rev. @LizTheo about how @TeamWarren is building a grassroots operation across the country. I’ve been to 20 states and Puerto Rico—and we’re just getting started!"
I’m fighting for @CDCgov funding to study gun violence alongside @BradyBuzz and @AMarch4OurLives. #WeNeedToKnow how to end the gun violence epidemic in our country once and for all.
"If you’re getting crushed by student loan debt, there’s a good chance our new bill will help. Use my calculator to see how much of your debt would get canceled under the Warren-Clyburn proposal:   #CancelMyDebt"
"My new plan with Rep. James Clyburn:

✅ Cancels student loan debt for more than 95% of people who carry it
✅Wipes out *all* debt for more than 75% of people who carry it 

It’s the big, structural change that our economy and our students need."
Part of confronting America’s racial wealth gap is acknowledging the role that our federal government played in keeping Black and Brown Americans from home ownership. That’s why my plan for fair housing provides assistance for families living in formerly redlined areas.
"Health care is a basic human right, but right now our health care is under attack. The rules are written in favor of Big Pharma and health insurance executives—while rural communities get kicked to the curb. Time for #MedicareForAll."
"I hope Iran chooses a different path. But let's be clear: Trump provoked this crisis. He has no strategy to contain it, he's burned through our friends and allies, and now he's doubling down on military force. We can't afford another forever war."
"I don’t spend time at fancy fundraisers. Instead, I spend my time meeting voters and thanking grassroots donors who chip in what they can. Donate $3 to my campaign, and you might just get a call from me to thank you!"
"It was never about a cake—it’s about making sure no one has a license to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans. The lower court needs to make the right decision, and until then, we’ll keep fighting for equal rights."
"Deeply saddened by the loss of my friend Frank LaMere. Frank was a longtime @DNC member and @WinnebagoTribe activist, and I’m going to miss him."
"Right now, the average cost of child care for one child can take up to 36% of a family’s total income. My plan for #UniversalChildCare would make child care free for millions of families and affordable for everyone."
This is exactly right. Congress should pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive health care for everyone.
Facebook has too much power and a terrible track record when it comes to protecting our private information. We need to hold them accountable—not give them the chance to access even more user data. #BreakUpBigTech
"Woo-hoo! I’m deeply grateful that you’re part of this fight. One by one, we’re going to return the power to the people and win in 2020. #NVertheless"
"I’m proud to endorse Tiffany Cabán for Queens DA in New York. @CabanForQueens will fight for working families and work to end mass incarceration. Make sure you get out and vote for Tiffany next Tuesday, June 25th. In the meantime, head to   to volunteer!"
We need the people making investment decisions to look like the rest of America. That’s why I have a new plan: A Small Business Equity Fund to help close the startup capital gap for entrepreneurs of color.
"Juneteenth isn’t just about celebrating the end of slavery in Texas. It’s a necessary reminder that 154 years later, Black Americans still feel the harsh reality that the fight for racial equality in our country is far from over. I’m in that fight all the way."
"Donald Trump’s treatment of those seeking a better life in our country is inhumane. Make no mistake: In a Warren administration, we will defend and protect immigrants and their families."
"#UniversalChildCare is personal for me. I struggled to find care for my babies—until my Aunt Bee stepped in. Not everyone is lucky enough to have an Aunt Bee, and this plan is for them. Try my calculator to see how much you'd save under my plan."
"I’ve got a plan—and now a bill—for #UniversalChildCare. Today, Rep. @Deb4CongressNM and I introduced a new proposal that would make high-quality, affordable child care a reality for every family in America."
"At @UniteThePoor’s #PPCMoralCongress yesterday, I talked with @RevDrBarber and Rev. @LizTheo about how @TeamWarren is building a grassroots operation across the country. I’ve been to 20 states and Puerto Rico—and we’re just getting started!"
I’m fighting for @CDCgov funding to study gun violence alongside @BradyBuzz and @AMarch4OurLives. #WeNeedToKnow how to end the gun violence epidemic in our country once and for all.
"If you’re getting crushed by student loan debt, there’s a good chance our new bill will help. Use my calculator to see how much of your debt would get canceled under the Warren-Clyburn proposal:   #CancelMyDebt"
"My new plan with Rep. James Clyburn:

✅ Cancels student loan debt for more than 95% of people who carry it
✅Wipes out *all* debt for more than 75% of people who carry it 

It’s the big, structural change that our economy and our students need."
Part of confronting America’s racial wealth gap is acknowledging the role that our federal government played in keeping Black and Brown Americans from home ownership. That’s why my plan for fair housing provides assistance for families living in formerly redlined areas.
"Health care is a basic human right, but right now our health care is under attack. The rules are written in favor of Big Pharma and health insurance executives—while rural communities get kicked to the curb. Time for #MedicareForAll."
"I hope Iran chooses a different path. But let's be clear: Trump provoked this crisis. He has no strategy to contain it, he's burned through our friends and allies, and now he's doubling down on military force. We can't afford another forever war."
"I don’t spend time at fancy fundraisers. Instead, I spend my time meeting voters and thanking grassroots donors who chip in what they can. Donate $3 to my campaign, and you might just get a call from me to thank you!"
"It was never about a cake—it’s about making sure no one has a license to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans. The lower court needs to make the right decision, and until then, we’ll keep fighting for equal rights."
"Deeply saddened by the loss of my friend Frank LaMere. Frank was a longtime @DNC member and @WinnebagoTribe activist, and I’m going to miss him."
We’re in the fight for racial and economic justice. Thank you @RevDrBarber and Rev. @LizTheo for a powerful conversation at the #PPCMoralCongress!
I agree with @IAmJohnOliver: No president is above the law. Congress should do its job and begin impeachment proceedings.
"At the #BlackPresidentialForum this weekend, we talked about how discrimination was actively fostered by the U.S. government—and how I have multiple plans to close the racial wealth gap."
"I’m still heartsick for the lives we lost that day. In a Warren administration, we will use the Justice Department to end the rise of white supremacy."
It’s an honor to fight for economic justice alongside @RevDrBarber and Rev. @LizTheo! Looking forward to the @UniteThePoor’s #PPCMoralCongress today and discussing how we can overcome systemic racism and inequality. Tune in at 4:00 PM ET to watch:
We can end the student loan debt crisis that’s crushing millions of Americans—and we can make universal free college a reality. Will you become a citizen co-sponsor of Rep. James Clyburn’s and my bill to solve the student loan debt crisis? #CancelMyDebt
"We can’t build a future by crushing the dreams and hopes of our young people. That's why Rep. James Clyburn and I introduced a bill to cancel up to $50,000 of your student loan debt, so that you can achieve your goals and dreams. #CancelMyDebt"
"For far too long the American Dream has been out of reach for Black business owners. I've got a plan to fix that, starting with a $7 billion dollar fund to help them start and grow their own small businesses. #BlackPresidentialForum"
"I hope you’ll read this powerful story from my friend, @AdyBarkan. We need #MedicareForAll—and you bet I’m fighting for it all the way."
I knew my father always had my back. He wanted to make sure I could chase after my dreams. Here’s why I wouldn’t be here today if my daddy hadn’t pushed open a door so I could have a fighting chance.
"Happy Father’s Day to all the dads who are fighting for their children’s futures—and who set the example every day of what it means to care for the people you love. My daddy was a cool guy. He taught me to dream big and fight hard, and I wish I could call him today."
"Dana Martin. Ashanti Carmon. Claire Legato. Muhlaysia Booker. Paris Cameron. Michelle “Tamika” Washington. Chynal Lindsey. Jazzaline Ware. Chanel Scurlock. And now Zoe Spears. The murder of Black trans women is a crisis. We’ll fight this, and we will continue to say their names."
"Today seven years ago, President @BarackObama implemented #DACA to give a generation of immigrants a chance to build a future in the country they call home. I will #DefendDACA and keep standing up to Donald Trump’s cruel attacks on immigrant communities."
"My new plan will create jobs, spur economic growth, and move us closer to an America where everyone has a fair shot to succeed."
It should be quick and easy to join a union. Let’s keep up this fight so casino workers in Nevada and across the country have the right to unionize and collectively bargain. #FightFor15
We need to do better by America’s workers—and that means economic justice. I’m in the #FightFor15 because we need to make living wages a reality.
"My friend @JasonKander is a powerful advocate for our veterans and breaking down the stigma around PTSD. Thank you for your bravery, Jason."
"Every American should have a fair shot at starting a small business—but today, the playing field is tilted against Black and Brown entrepreneurs. My new plan would put an end to that."
"My first Democratic presidential primary debate is on Wednesday, June 26 on @NBCNews—and I can’t wait to discuss my plans for big, structural change. Will you chip in $3 now to keep up the momentum before June 26?"
"Jared Kushner is a walking conflict of interest. After he failed to fully divest from his family’s real estate empire, Freddie Mac is now guaranteeing Kushner Cos. an $800 million loan. We need answers on whether his company got special treatment."

"If you have good ideas and work hard, you should be able to build a small business and make a living. Black and Brown entrepreneurs are held back by a start-up capital gap that makes it harder to start and grow their business. I've got a plan to fix that."
I’d love to grab a drink and chat with you. Donate here to be automatically entered—and I hope I’ll see you soon!

Don’t take the selfie without me!
"I’m relieved that the governor of Puerto Rico has requested that this bill, which would allow religious freedom to be used as an excuse to discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, be withdrawn. Now let's keep fighting for the LGBTQ+ community."
"The Small Business Equity Fund will create jobs, spur economic growth, and move us closer to an America where everyone has a fair shot to succeed. And the entire cost of this plan will be paid for by my Ultra-Millionaire Tax. Read my full plan here:"
This tilts the field against entrepreneurs of color. So I plan to address this disparity head on too. I will require states and cities administering my new Fund to work with diverse investment managers—putting $7 billion in the hands of minority-and women-owned managers.
"But even if we fully close the startup capital gap, deep systemic issues will continue to tilt the playing field. 86% of venture capitalists are white, and studies show that investors are more likely to partner with entrepreneurs who look like them."
"$7 billion ensures that if Black, Latinx, & Native American entrepreneurs start businesses at the same rate as white entrepreneurs, we could fully close the startup capital gap for the next ten years—supporting over 100,000 new businesses and 1.1 million new jobs."
"As president, I will launch a $7 billion Small Business Equity Fund to provide grants to entrepreneurs—not loans or loan guarantees. Loans aren’t as good as equity because they leave businesses with debt when they’re trying to grow. Equity helps businesses thrive from the start."
"That disparity in startup capital is creating a small business gap that costs us millions of jobs & billions in economic growth. And it's another example of how the racial wealth gap in America hurts Black, Latinx, Native American, and other minority families & communities."
"On average, Black, Latinx, Native American, and other minority households have significantly less wealth than white households. So they have less to put into their small businesses, and less collateral to get outside credit."
"The racial wealth gap tilts the playing field against entrepreneurs of color, holding back our economy. The government helped create that wealth gap, and the government has an obligation to address it. I have a new plan to tackle it head on."
"Thank you, @EdOfTheNotch. I’m honored to have your support."
"Mueller’s statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He’s referring Trump for impeachment. Yesterday, Trump said—once again—that he’d take information from a foreign government. It’s up to Congress to act."
"A hostile foreign government interfered in the 2016 election, and Trump welcomed their help. Now Trump says he’ll welcome that help again. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: We have a constitutional responsibility to begin impeachment proceedings."
This bill is an important first step. But we can't let future generations be trapped by another student debt crisis. That's why I've also got a plan to provide universal free public college for all. Read all about it here:
You can use my student debt calculator to find out how much you could save if we pass the Warren-Clyburn proposal:
"We'll free up an entire generation so that they can buy homes, launch businesses, and start their families. And our bill will also provide an enormous middle-class stimulus and reduce the racial wealth gap."

"Student loan debt is crushing an entire generation. That’s why Rep. James Clyburn—who has always been a leader on economic justice issues—and I are introducing a truly transformational bill to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans. #CancelMyDebt"
"This made me laugh. (You’re fine, Varsha!) It was great chatting with you."
"Health care is a basic human right—and we fight for basic human rights. When I lead the Democratic Party, we will be a party that says: We’re the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, so yes, we can afford #MedicareForAll."
"Massachusetts has always been a leader in the fight for quality, affordable health care, and I was proud to lend my support to their fight for Medicare for All. Now let's get this done for everyone across the country."
"The #MuellerReport made it clear: A foreign government attacked our 2016 elections to support Trump, Trump welcomed that help, and Trump obstructed the investigation. Now, he said he'd do it all over again. It's time to impeach Donald Trump."
Trump’s companies continue to take money from foreign governments with business before his White House. This reeks of corruption. My #EndCorruptionNow bill would make these conflicts of interest illegal.
"This is just another petty, cruel way for the Trump administration to signal they won't support or defend LGBTQ+ communities at home or abroad. We should fly the Pride flag proudly—and take real, meaningful actions to bolster & protect LGBTQ+ civil rights."
"My heart is with the people of Hong Kong as they fight for their freedoms and the rule of law, even in the face of violence from their own government. The United States will always stand with those who stand up for democracy and human rights around the world."
No one should be afraid to be who they are at work. That's why I've co-sponsored the Equality Act in the Senate—and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.
"When 49 people were murdered at Pulse three years ago, it was an attack on our LGBTQ+ and Latinx communities. Today I’m remembering the victims and their loved ones, and I promise to #HonorThemWithAction by continuing to fight for #GunReformNow."
"Running for president: That’s what girls do. I’m glad to have you both in this fight, Tracy!"
Religious freedom cannot be used as an excuse to discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community. Everyone deserves to live and love freely—no exceptions.
"Right now, America’s foreign policies work great for the rich and powerful but fail everyone else. We need to recognize that policies that undermine working families in this country also erode America’s strength in the world. As president, I’ll change that."
Our environment is in crisis—but I have a plan. My Green Manufacturing Plan helps our planet and creates over a million new green jobs. Will you chip in $3 to help keep up the momentum and turn this plan into reality?
My plan would provide thousands of families with a real chance to buy a home — the same opportunities the government denied to previous generations of residents of the area.
My housing plan creates a first-of-its-kind down-payment assistance program. First-time homebuyers who live in formerly redlined neighborhoods or communities that were segregated by law and are currently low-income are eligible for assistance.
The legacy of our federal government’s racist redlining policies still hurts Black and Brown families. The gap between white homeownership and Black homeownership rates today is about 30% — bigger than it was in 1960 when housing discrimination was legal.
"I grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class. My daddy ended up as a janitor and my mother worked the phones at Sears. We didn’t have much money—but like millions of other families, we got by. Today I’m in this fight to make our government and economy work for working people."
"Tech entrepreneurs should have a fighting chance to compete against giants like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. My plan to #BreakUpBigTech is good for small businesses and good for our economy."

Tomorrow is Primary Day in Virginia! I hope the people of Virginia head to the polls and make their voices heard. Find your polling place here:
"I'm in this fight for our children's futures—starting with #UniversalChildCare and early education for all of our kids, paid for with a tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans. Chip in $3, or whatever you can, to help fight for big, structural change."
Saudi Arabia’s coalition has killed Yemeni civilians with bombs stamped Made in America. Now the White House is handing over sensitive smart bomb technology to Saudi Arabia. Enough. Time to end support for this cruel and senseless war.
Our government is failing those who have risked everything for a shot at a better life in our country. This is inhumane and we need answers—now.
Thank you @IowaDemocrats for a great Hall of Fame event!
"Stopped by a #WinWithWarren organizing house party in Waterloo yesterday afternoon to thank grassroots @teamwarren supporters. From tackling climate change and flooding head on, to doing right by our farmers, I’m in this fight all the way."
"For me, this fight is personal. From #UniversalChildCare to free public college, I’ve got plans to level the playing field for working families. With @iowademocrats and grassroots supporters across the country, we’ll turn those plans into big, structural change."
Running for president: That's what women do!
"Loopholes, deductions, exemptions. There are lots of benefits to being a corporation like Amazon—which made over $10 billion in profits and paid $0 in federal corporate income taxes last year. My Real Corporate Profits Tax would make corporations like Amazon pay their fair share."
Today I'm thinking about the people marching in the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. We need leadership that puts the interests of all U.S. citizens—including our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico—ahead of Wall Street’s profit margins.
"Last week when I was in Michigan, I rolled out a new plan to fight climate change and create over a million new jobs. Read more about my Green Manufacturing Plan here."
"I didn’t march in last year’s @bostonpride Parade—I danced! The whole march is a celebration of unity and love, and a chance to recommit to fighting like hell for LGBTQ+ equality. Happy Pride, Boston! #WickedProud #BostonPride"
"I’m proud that Massachusetts was the first state to make marriage equality the law of the land—and I’m deeply grateful every time I get to march in the @bostonpride parade. Though I’m not there in person this year, I’m fighting alongside you today and every day! #WickedProud"
"I got an important question in Lansing earlier this week. On #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay, and every day, I’m fighting my heart out to end the gun violence epidemic in this country and fight the @NRA’s influence on our government."
"Here’s what my Green Manufacturing Plan would do:

✅Make a real investment in science
✅Commit $1.5 trillion to our federal government to buy American and buy green
✅Develop and manufacture American products here to sell all around the world"
"Payday lenders spent buckets of money on Trump's campaign and properties. Then Trump's @CFPB director, Kathy Kraninger, did the predatory payday lending industry a huge favor by rolling back important regulations. It's corruption, plain and simple."
"When I was in Michigan this week, I met a lot of young people who were fired up and ready to fight for big, structural change. I’m glad to see Michigan make it easier for college students to vote!"
"Trump's former chief of staff played a huge role in the inhumane family separation policy. Now John Kelly's joining the board of a company that runs Homestead, the largest detention center for migrant kids. Rep. @PramilaJayapal and I are demanding answers."
"I’m deeply grateful for your support, Rod!"

"For me, this fight is personal. From #UniversalChildCare to free public college, I’ve got plans to level the playing field for working families. With @iowademocrats and grassroots supporters across the country, we’ll turn those plans into big, structural change."
Running for president: That's what women do!
"Loopholes, deductions, exemptions. There are lots of benefits to being a corporation like Amazon—which made over $10 billion in profits and paid $0 in federal corporate income taxes last year. My Real Corporate Profits Tax would make corporations like Amazon pay their fair share."
Today I'm thinking about the people marching in the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. We need leadership that puts the interests of all U.S. citizens—including our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico—ahead of Wall Street’s profit margins.
"Last week when I was in Michigan, I rolled out a new plan to fight climate change and create over a million new jobs. Read more about my Green Manufacturing Plan here."
"I didn’t march in last year’s @bostonpride Parade—I danced! The whole march is a celebration of unity and love, and a chance to recommit to fighting like hell for LGBTQ+ equality. Happy Pride, Boston! #WickedProud #BostonPride"
"I’m proud that Massachusetts was the first state to make marriage equality the law of the land—and I’m deeply grateful every time I get to march in the @bostonpride parade. Though I’m not there in person this year, I’m fighting alongside you today and every day! #WickedProud"
"I got an important question in Lansing earlier this week. On #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay, and every day, I’m fighting my heart out to end the gun violence epidemic in this country and fight the @NRA’s influence on our government."
"Here’s what my Green Manufacturing Plan would do:

✅Make a real investment in science
✅Commit $1.5 trillion to our federal government to buy American and buy green
✅Develop and manufacture American products here to sell all around the world"
"Payday lenders spent buckets of money on Trump's campaign and properties. Then Trump's @CFPB director, Kathy Kraninger, did the predatory payday lending industry a huge favor by rolling back important regulations. It's corruption, plain and simple."
"When I was in Michigan this week, I met a lot of young people who were fired up and ready to fight for big, structural change. I’m glad to see Michigan make it easier for college students to vote!"
"Trump's former chief of staff played a huge role in the inhumane family separation policy. Now John Kelly's joining the board of a company that runs Homestead, the largest detention center for migrant kids. Rep. @PramilaJayapal and I are demanding answers."
"I’m deeply grateful for your support, Rod!"
"On #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay, I’m thinking about how our country loses an average of seven children and teens to gun violence every day. Enough is enough. I’m fighting like hell for #GunReformNow and to end the @NRA’s death grip on our federal government."
I’m grateful to fight alongside this team every day and celebrate #Pride with them all month long!
"We had a great organizing event in Detroit earlier this week, and one of the best parts was receiving more notes from people in the selfie line! I love reading about what gets people into this fight for big, structural change."
"Ninety-five town halls completed, 28,000 pictures taken, 425 audience questions answered—and we’re just getting started. Thank you to everyone who tuned in or showed up to our #WarrenTownHall last night!"
"The Hyde Amendment limits women's access to safe, legal abortion—particularly women of color.  It’s time for Hyde to go."
"I'm in the fight for reproductive rights all the way. We need to:

✅End the #HydeAmendment and Trump’s gag rule
✅Pass the EACH Woman Act 
✅Ensure that #MedicareForAll includes contraception and abortion coverage
✅Defend #TitleX family planning funding"
"Thank you to the community of Elkhart for an inspiring organizing event yesterday. I’m grateful down to my toes to have you in this fight, and I’ll never stop fighting for new, good jobs in Indiana and across the country."
"Here’s what really troubles me: The Trump administration keeps trying to deny science across the board. At our #WarrenTownHall, I made it clear: Climate change is one of the biggest crises we face, and we need to make big, structural changes in order to address it head on."
"To me, this is what leadership is about: You start with what you believe is right, and you get out there and fight for it."
"On today's #DDay75thAnniversary, we remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought to liberate Europe and secure the world's freedom. We honor them by fighting to make the world a better and more just place, today and every day."
"My campaign has submitted their support to join @IBEW 2320. Every worker who wants to join a union, bargain collectively, & make their voice heard should have a chance to do so. The labor movement has long fought for the dignity of working people, & we’re proud to be part of it."
Of course I stayed for selfies after our #WarrenTownHall! I’m deeply grateful for everyone who tuned in.
"Gov. Inslee is exactly right. Climate change is the biggest challenge we face. Every candidate running for president should have a serious set of policies to address it, and should be eager to defend those proposals in a debate."
The Hyde Amendment harms the most vulnerable women and limits their ability to safely access abortion. It's time for Hyde to go. #WarrenTownHall
"I’m here because I’m a fighter. We can give up or we can get in this fight together. That’s how we’re going to build our grassroots movement, win in 2020, and make big, structural change. Will you chip in $3 to our Official 2020 campaign? #WarrenTownHall"
"Mueller’s statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He’s referring President Trump for impeachment, and it’s up to Congress to act. And they should. #WarrenTownHall"
"If we want good jobs in our country, then we need stronger unions and more power in the hands of the people. It should be quick and easy to join a union. Unions built the middle class, and unions will rebuild the middle class. #WarrenTownHall"
"When our country went to the moon, we did it by investing in science, innovation, and our workers. That’s what we need to do right now to make the #GreenNewDeal a reality. Read more about how my Green Manufacturing Plan would help us get there."
"In 2005, millions of families were at the edge: Losing their jobs, homes, and savings. Meanwhile credit card companies wanted to wring every last dime out of them. I got in the fight all the way for those families because you don’t get what you don’t fight for. #WarrenTownHall"
"Here’s the deal: Our opioid crisis is getting worse. We need big, structural change to address it. My opioid plan with Rep. Elijah Cummings includes $100 billion to hit this opioid epidemic head on and bring it to its knees. Let’s save the people we love. #WarrenTownHall"
"On #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay, I’m thinking about how our country loses an average of seven children and teens to gun violence every day. Enough is enough. I’m fighting like hell for #GunReformNow and to end the @NRA’s death grip on our federal government."

"You can’t just wave your arms and make jobs happen. You have to have a plan—and I do. My Green Manufacturing Plan would create more than a million new, good jobs on which people can build a future. We need to do right by workers in Indiana and across the country. #WarrenTownHall"
"The immoral Hyde Amendment should not be the law. I’ll fight like hell to overturn it. Every time we deny women access to safe, legal abortion, we put their lives in danger. #WarrenTownHall"
"We’re in Fort Wayne tonight because the people of Indiana know we need an economy that works not just for the people at the top, but for everyone. We need our economy and government to work for the people—and that’s what we’re fighting to do. #WarrenTownHall"
"In just a few minutes, I’ll be live from Fort Wayne, Indiana at our @MSNBC town hall! I hope you’ll tune in. #WarrenTownHall"
Don’t forget to tune in!
"YAY, my @teamwarren Pride merch is here! Looking forward to wearing this shirt all #PrideMonth long."
"Yesterday in Lansing, we talked about how we need to defend and create American jobs—not cater to the interests of Wall Street. My Green Manufacturing Plan would create over a million good, new jobs that will help working families in Michigan and across the country."
"Roe v. Wade has been the law of the land for over 46 years—but that isn’t stopping extreme lawmakers who are closer than ever to outlawing safe, legal abortion. Read more about my plan for Congressional action to protect choice:"
"Our second @MSNBC town hall is tonight—see you soon, @chrislhayes! Tune in at 8 PM ET to watch me answer questions live from Fort Wayne, Indiana about the future of our country. #WarrenTownHall"
"Yay—William guessed that it was me on the first try! This is how I’m doing “call time” on our grassroots campaign: On the phone with grassroots donors, not at swanky fundraisers."
"This is a big win for Nevada, and I’m glad to see state employees organize and make their voices heard. Unions built the middle class and unions will rebuild the middle class."
"Right now, Washington is broken. But I still believe in Bobby Kennedy’s ripple of hope. I believe that history is shaped from numberless diverse acts of courage. And you bet I’ll keep fighting for a better America."
But that promise isn’t gone. It’s not gone in the eyes of the people I meet who remember Bobby’s presidential campaign in 1968. And it’s not gone in the millions of people who still believe that we can build a better future for our children and grandchildren.
"I remember how, when Bobby Kennedy was assassinated 51 years ago today, the promise of a better America seemed to vanish. Our country continued down a dangerous road where the rich got richer, and everyone else got left behind."
"Grateful down to my toes for the fired-up, grassroots supporters at our organizing event in Detroit today. Together we can level the playing field for working families in Michigan and across the country."
I’m glad to see House Democrats pass a Dream Act with 237 votes today. Now the Senate needs to do its job and pass the #DreamAndPromiseNow act.
"As we celebrate 100 years of the #19thAmendment, we recommit to fighting the systemic barriers that have disenfranchised women of color for generations. Let’s start with a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote for everyone."
"My Green Manufacturing Plan is a win for our planet, our workers, and our economy. Here’s how it works."
"With big and bold investments in research, our industries, and our workers, we can lead the global effort to combat climate change—and create more than a million good jobs here at home."
"This is sickening. Children belong with their families, period. We need answers on the Trump administration’s appalling practices at the border. And we need them now."
"You can’t just wave your arms and make jobs happen. You have to have a plan—and I do. My Green Manufacturing Plan would create more than a million new, good jobs on which people can build a future. We need to do right by workers in Indiana and across the country. #WarrenTownHall"

"Glad to stand with you in this fight. Together, we can save our planet."
America’s public school teachers deserve more respect. I stand with @WeAreNHTA and our teachers in California who are fighting for higher pay. #WeAreCTA
"I’m praying for Johana Medina Leon and her loved ones. Not a single person should die in ICE custody. We need to call out the number of trans women of color who’ve died under ICE custody, and we need answers."
"Today, I took @DemRedistrict’s pledge to support fair districts and end partisan gerrymandering. I’m with @EricHolder all the way. The power belongs to the people, and voters should choose their representatives—not the other way around. #FairMaps"
"Some big, “American” companies will ship jobs overseas and hollow out our cities if it'll save them a nickel. And many already have. I've got a plan to make sure a Warren administration will defend and create good American jobs."
My green manufacturing plan rewards American companies who invest at home. It's funded by my Real Corporate Profits Tax on giant companies who try to dodge their fair share in taxes. It'll create 1M new jobs & make the U.S. the leader in the global fight against climate change.
"Third, a Green Marshall Plan. The government will use all its tools to boost American industry and cut global emissions abroad. We will deploy U.S.-manufactured clean energy technology to every corner of the world, and I'll commit at least $100 billion to do it."
"Second: a Green Industrial Mobilization. I'll commit $1.5 trillion to buy clean, renewable, and emission-free energy products, supporting only American companies who manufacture here at home and treat workers with respect, to boost demand and galvanize our clean energy industry."
"My green manufacturing plan has three parts. First: A Green Apollo Program, investing $400 billion in a National Institute of Clean Energy to invest in revolutionary clean energy tech. And I will require that production from this R&D takes place here in the U.S.—no excuses."
"With bold investments, we can fight climate change, achieve the ambitious targets of the Green New Deal, and create more than a million good jobs here at home. I have a plan to invest at least $2 trillion in green research, manufacturing, and exporting:"
"This is not a question of more or less government: It’s about who the government works for. And in the weeks ahead, I’ll be releasing more plans on how this vision of economic patriotism should shape our economy, from trade policy to Wall Street. Here's my first proposal:"
"My administration will boost American workers—and I've already got a plan for that. We'll start with a new federal agency with one mission: Defend & create American jobs. That agency will use aggressive new tools to boost American workers, not Wall Street."
"Giant companies who like to call themselves ""American"" have one real loyalty: Their shareholders. They'll ship jobs overseas and hollow out our cities if it'll save them a nickel. For too long, Washington politicians have let them call the shots. But not on my watch."
"As the holy month of Ramadan ends, Bruce and I wish a joyous Eid al-Fitr to all Muslims celebrating in the United States and around the world. Eid Mubarak!"
How are giant corporations getting away with this? Because the #GOPTaxScam lowered their effective tax rate to the lowest it’s been since 1947. My Real Corporate Profits Tax would make sure the biggest and most profitable corporations pay their fair share.
"Our new campaign account just launched! My team wants to make it easier for our grassroots community to stay connected and get the latest on our plans for big, structural change. Give @teamwarren a follow and help spread the word."
"I’m glad to see Illinois take a stand for women’s reproductive health care. Now, we need Congress to pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care across the country."
"Amber pays $1,150 a month for child care, and it’s holding her family back. Her family is one of the reasons why I’m fighting for #UniversalChildCare: High-quality child care that’s free for millions of families and affordable for everyone."
Just got back from California and my pick up at the airport included a very sweet boy.
"Thanks, Ashlee! I loved our conversation, and I’m grateful down to my toes that you’re in this fight."
"Glad to stand with you in this fight. Together, we can save our planet."

I love reading the notes that grassroots supporters hand me during selfie lines. They keep me going.
"Google has too much power, and they're using that power to hurt small businesses, stifle innovation, and tilt the playing field against everyone else. It's time to fight back. That's why I have a plan to break up Google and the other big tech companies."
How much money would you save under my plan for Universal Child Care? Try it for yourself.
We’ve got to do better for moms like Jennifer. Read more about my plan for #UniversalChildCare here:
"If Donald Trump were anyone other than the President of the United States right now, he’d be in handcuffs and indicted. My new plan would actually hold presidents accountable for violating the law."
Thank you for fighting hard and living proud. Happy #PrideMonth!
I’ve answered 414 town hall questions since launching our campaign—and I’m looking forward to answering some more at our @MSNBC town hall with @chrislhayes this Wednesday. I hope you’ll tune in!
"The time for small ideas is over. Big problems call for big solutions. If we’re going to save our democracy, clean up the corruption in Washington, and build an economy that works for all of us, then we need big, structural changes. And yeah, I have a plan for that."
"Here’s the thing: When a candidate tells you about all the things that aren’t possible, about how political calculations come first, they’re telling you something very important. They’re telling you that they will not fight for you. Not me. I’m here to fight for our country."
"#PrideMonth is a celebration. And it’s a time to remember the trailblazers who fought for LGBTQ+ civil rights. Today—and every day—we renew our commitment to fight until everyone can live proudly, without fear. I’ll be right there alongside you. Happy #Pride!"
"The barriers holding back the floodwaters failed, and the building in downtown Burlington where we filmed this video is now flooded. The impact of climate change in our country is real and we need to take action—now."
"Our country is in a time of crisis—the time for small ideas is over. That's why I'm fighting for big, structural change. #CADem19"
"I'll be live soon at @MoveOn's #BigIdeas Forum to talk about how we're going to build big, structural change. Tune in!"
"When I lead the Democratic Party, we will not be a party that nibbles around the edges. We will be a party of bold, structural change—and that doesn’t happen on its own. We need to dream big and fight hard because the rich and powerful aren’t giving up anything without a fight."
"What an amazing night, Oakland! We’re going to do this together."
This is what keeps me going: The energy of our grassroots supporters in Oakland and across the country. When we dream big and fight hard we can win in 2020. Let's do this together!
"Last night I got my 25,000th selfie—and it was a pinky promise! We’re going to dream big, fight hard, and win."
Thank you for waiting!
"Thank you to all 6,500 of you who came out to our largest town hall yet in Oakland!"
"Thank you, Oakland!"

"Last night I got my 25,000th selfie—and it was a pinky promise! We’re going to dream big, fight hard, and win."
Thank you for waiting!
"Thank you to all 6,500 of you who came out to our largest town hall yet in Oakland!"
"Thank you, Oakland!"
Tune in live now! ⬇️
"We are live in Oakland, California talking with our grassroots supporters about how we can make big, structural change together."
I’m heartsick and praying for the victims and their loved ones. Eleven people should not have been murdered today. How many lives will it take before Congress acts to end this crisis?
Glad to see Colorado—and Maine—officially ban cruel conversion therapy this week. LGBTQ+ Americans should feel free to be who they are and live without fear or discrimination. I won’t stop fighting for them.
"This is a win—but safe, legal abortion access for women in Missouri and across the country is still under attack. Extreme lawmakers are hell-bent on overturning #RoeVWade, and it’s more important than ever that we make our voices heard and #StopTheBans."
"I’m the daughter of a janitor (yup, that baby is me) who went on to become a candidate for president. Our campaign is fighting to build opportunity for our kids. Try our new calculator and find out how my #UniversalChildCare plan would help your family:"
"I’m running to be the first woman president—but this campaign wouldn’t be possible without the terrific and talented women on our team. Honored to be fighting alongside you, @FarrellGabriell!"
A California “Student Borrower Bill Of Rights” is a terrific idea! And we can help our students in all 50 states even more by making public college free and canceling student debt for 95% of Americans.
I’m glad to see the people of New Hampshire made their voices heard and repealed the death penalty. Thank you @rennycushing for leading the fight.
"I've got a lot of plans—like my plan for #UniversalChildCare. We can win in 2020 and make high-quality, affordable child care a reality, but only if we keep fighting together. Will you chip in $3 before our May fundraising deadline tonight at midnight?"
"Website or no website, let’s be clear: Giant tech companies like Apple have too much power. In order to protect our economy and our democracy, we need to #BreakUpBigTech and level the playing field for everyone else."
"This is a clear conflict of interest. We need to pull corruption out of Washington by the roots—and we can start with my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, the most ambitious anti-corruption plan since Watergate."
Our democracy only works if everyone can be held accountable. These changes will make sure that’s the case for generations to come. Read my full plan here:
"I pledge to nominate an Office of Legal Counsel head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a president cannot be indicted for criminal behavior. The OLC’s purpose is to govern the conduct of the executive branch, not act as the president’s get-out-of-jail-free card."
"Attorney General Bill Barr has disgraced himself by acting like Trump’s personal defense attorney. When I’m elected, I will appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one—not even a president—is above the law. And I’ll go one step further:"
One of the strongest arguments against indictment is that the Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to decide when to interfere with the President's duties. These new laws would eliminate that argument and remove any statutory ambiguity.
"Congress should pass a law clarifying that DOJ can indict the president if he or she commits a crime in office, and should amend our obstruction of justice statutes to explicitly allow for indictment when the President abuses the powers of the office—like Donald Trump did."
"No president should be above the law. So why does this Justice Department act like he is? Because in the 1970s Richard Nixon’s Justice Department wrote a memo saying so (yes, really) and DOJ has continued to stand by that view."
"The Mueller report is a clear roadmap for impeachment, because that’s the only path Mueller had. But impeachment shouldn’t be the only way that a president can be held accountable for committing a crime."
The Mueller report details crimes by the president that would lead to the indictment of any other citizen. But Mueller couldn’t bring charges because a Justice Department policy says you can’t charge a sitting president. That policy is wrong and needs to go. Here’s how and why.

"See you soon, California! Our organizing event in Oakland is tomorrow—will I see you there?"
There are only two more days before our May fundraising deadline. Will you chip in $3 now to help hit our goal? I might just give you a call to say thanks.
"I'm sorry I couldn't join you tonight, @BMCMovement. But I’m in this fight all the way, and I’ve got a plan to move our country forward."
Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson were fearless foot soldiers in the fight for LGBTQ+ civil rights. I’m glad to see that they will be honored with this monument for decades to come.
"In 448 pages, Special Counsel Mueller made it absolutely clear that Donald Trump obstructed justice, over and over again. Time for Congress to do its job and hold the President of the United States accountable."
"My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality, affordable child care and early learning for our kids—and will be free for millions of families thanks to my #UltraMillionaireTax on people worth more than $50 million. What will your family save?"
Extremist lawmakers want to outlaw abortion—and they’re hoping the Supreme Court will back their scheme. Congress must pass new federal laws if we want to protect access to reproductive care.
"This is how we are going to grow our grassroots movement: Person to person. Thank you, NYC!"
Jaime Harrison will fight hard for the people of South Carolina and take our country forward. Go Jaime!
This is a great step. My higher education plan would go even further for American Indian and Alaska Native students by making tuition free at any two-year or four-year public college and investing $50B in a fund for colleges including Tribal Colleges and Universities.
"We can provide affordable, high-quality child care to every child—& we can pay for it with my Ultra-Millionaire tax on the wealthiest 75,000 American families. I joined @TheView to talk about my plan for #UniversalChildCare & my new child care calculator:"

Our government is broken. But I have plans to fix it and return the power to the people. Will you chip in $3 to our Official 2020 Campaign? Whatever you’re able to give will help us hit our May fundraising goal and keep up our momentum.
I’m fighting for #UniversalChildCare because our kids deserve a fair shot at success. Here’s how my plan works.
No federal lobbyists. No PACs. No swanky fundraisers. We’re funding this campaign people to people. Will you chip in whatever you can and be a part of this movement? I might even call you to say thanks!
This is what keeps me going on the road: Seeing fired up supporters across the country. I’m grateful to have spent the weekend in Iowa—and looking forward to being in Michigan and Indiana soon. Will I see you there?
"Corruption? I’ve got a plan for that. Income inequality? I’ve got a plan for that. Mountains of student loan debt crushing grassroots donors like Cody? I’ve got a plan for that, too! Let’s keep working on these issues together."
"Child care should be a right for all, not a privilege for the wealthy. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees affordable, high-quality child care and early education for every child in America."

I stand with @MothersOutFront. We need to use every tool available to combat climate change.
"“Global warming” isn’t a punchline—it’s a crisis. On day one of a Warren administration, I’ll sign a moratorium on fossil fuel drilling on public lands."
"I grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class. Like a million other families, we got by. Today, I’m fighting to level the playing field so that every American family has a shot at building something real. Chip in and help keep up the momentum."
Looking forward to visiting Michigan and Indiana for the first time as a presidential candidate this week! I hope I’ll see you at an event soon.
"My #UniversalChildCare plan quadruples the federal investment in child care, and offers high-quality options for every family. We’ll pay for it with my #UltraMillionaireTax on the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans. It’s a win for our kids and our economy."
Did @stevenmnuchin1 help his billionaire buddy siphon off more than $2 billion in Sears assets? @AOC and I are demanding answers.
"When the Mueller report came out on April 18th, I read it. The next day, I told @maddow this is a point of principle."
"Mueller leaves no doubt:
1) He didn't exonerate the president because there is evidence he committed crimes.
2) Justice Department policy prevented him from charging the president with any crimes. 
3) The Constitution leaves it up to Congress to act—and that's impeachment."
"Mueller’s statement makes clear what those who have read his report know: It is an impeachment referral, and it’s up to Congress to act. They should."
He’s always so happy to see me (even if I’m just coming home from the grocery store).
"Thank you for reading, Lizz and Theia!"
"This weekend in IA, I answered my 400th question as a presidential candidate—and it was all about health care. I promised Teresa: No one should go bankrupt over medical problems and you bet I’m going to fight for Medicare for All."
"What gets you up in the morning? I ask that question everywhere I go. People are worried about corruption, climate change, inequality—and I’ve got plans to fight all that, plus more. Chip in $3, or whatever you can, and help me keep the momentum up."
"If this health care center closes, Missouri will become the only state in our country where women won’t have access to safe, legal abortion. That’s why I’m urging Congress to pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care, including abortion, in every state."
"I’m very grateful that Camille contributed to this campaign, so I left a voicemail thanking her. This is how we’re going to do it—all of us coming together to pitch in."
I’m the daughter of a janitor who became a United States senator and now candidate for president. Our campaign is fighting to build opportunity for our kids and grandkids. Will you chip in $4 to help grow our movement?

"The consequences of climate change are severe, and they are already affecting places like Burlington, Iowa. We have a moral responsibility to act—now."

I’m honoring our fallen service members with @votevets this #MemorialDay. Please take a moment today to remember their names. No matter how you spend your Memorial Day—I hope you have a meaningful day.

"All three of my big brothers served in the military. I remember waiting by the mailbox with my mother for news—how days with a letter were extra sunny. My brothers made it home safely, but many service members did not. On this #MemorialDay and every day, we honor their sacrifice."
"Loved stopping by the Smokey Row coffee shop in Oskaloosa. (I’m more of a tea person, but you bet my team loves coffee!)"
"Grateful for everyone who came out to our #WinWithWarren organizing house party in Oskaloosa, IA today. Our movement begins with fired-up grassroots supporters all across the country."
"Greetings from our walk in Pella, Iowa. (That’s the Tulip Toren behind us.)"
"When our communities are hit by storms, floods, or hurricanes, we reach out and help our neighbors. But Washington is so broken that one Republican congressman is holding up a disaster relief package to help struggling families. That's not who we are as Americans."
"The fight for #UniversalChildCare is personal for me. Back when I was a mom with two little kids, finding high-quality, affordable child care was make-it-or-break-it. My plan for #UniversalChildCare is a win for working families and our kids."

"Another sick attack on transgender Americans coming from the White House. All LGBTQ+ people should be able to access high-quality, gender-affirming health care. Period."
A $2.3 billion compensation package—for one CEO. The system is rigged and we need to fix it.
These couples want to open their hearts and their homes—and the Trump administration wants to allow adoption agencies to discriminate against them and deny children loving homes. This is pointlessly cruel.
"It's revolting to suggest that we need to help the Saudis kill civilians in order to stand up to Iran. Our only ""emergency"" is a President who cares more about making money for his defense contractor buddies than the democratic will of Congress or the moral catastrophe in Yemen."
"Congress voted to tell @realDonaldTrump to end the United States' complicity in Yemen's ongoing humanitarian crisis. His response? Veto the resolution, then declare a fake ""emergency"" to keep selling weapons the Saudis will use to kill more civilians."
Missouri’s new abortion ban is unconstitutional and will hurt women. We need to #StopTheBans by passing federal laws that ensure real access to birth control and abortion care for all women.
Incarcerated Americans shouldn’t have to pay to talk to the people they love. I stand with the activists in Connecticut who are working to make prison calls free.
"Alabama’s abortion law is dangerous and unconstitutional. I stand with @PPact and the @ACLU all the way, and I’ll keep fighting to pass new federal laws in Congress that protect access to reproductive care from right-wing ideologues in the states."
I’m proud to have signed the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge. Our campaign isn’t beholden to Big Oil or any corporate interest—our campaign is by the people and for the people.

"Wow, that looks great Meaghan! (I have to say, the cardboard cut-out was a nice touch.) Right now our team is organizing #WinWithWarren debate watch parties across the country next month. RSVP to one near you:"
Bailey was a bad boy this morning. But at least he’s sorry.
"When I called Nicholas after he made a small donation, he knew it was me right away! We’re both fired up about living wages, so we talked about @SEIU’s fight to raise the minimum wage to $15. We need to do better by America’s workers. #FightFor15"
I stand in solidarity with the @McDonalds workers who are fighting for a living wage and better working conditions. #FightFor15
Six children have died after being detained by @CBP. That’s six children too many. We need answers—now.
"Trump promised to bring our troops home, but now he’s willing to send thousands more to the Middle East. I'll fight to stop this administration from dragging us into another forever war."
"Thank you, Sarah, this is an amazing program! Working on campaigns should be accessible to all people. Keep fighting the good fight."
I've been fighting against this anti-consumer proposal for years—and I'm glad it's been delayed so that it can be rewritten. People shouldn't be locked into unreasonable contracts that they didn't negotiate and that limit their right to go to court.
"Everywhere I go, I talk about how we need to make big, structural change to solve the deep, systemic problems we face as a country. Take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: We had a plan, we got organized, and we turned it into a reality."
"If we want to live in a world where our children have clean water to drink, then we need to take action now."
That’s exactly right. And I have a plan to open the door of opportunity for millions of Americans struggling with student loan debt. Read about it here:
"I’m ready to fight for you, Allison, and the millions of people across the country who are getting crushed by student loan debt. Let’s do this together. #CancelMyDebt"
It doesn’t have to be this way. And I have a plan to change it.
"I’m fighting with you, Amber. We can change this."
"My affordable housing plan would prohibit housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBTQ+ Americans deserve good-quality, affordable housing. I’m ready to fight for them."
Young people are getting crushed by student loan debt. Not only can they not afford to buy homes or start families—it’s forcing some to drop out before even getting a degree. My plan to cancel student loan debt for 42 million Americans would level the playing field.
I’m keeping families in the Mississippi Delta in my prayers. Record flooding is pushing families out of their homes and submerging neighborhoods. Climate change is here and it’s hurting our communities. We have a moral responsibility to act.
"This is a bad deal. Merging @sprint and @TMobile to create one giant telecom company will hurt small businesses, entrepreneurs, and working families."
"Harvey Milk's campaign manager, Anne Kronenberg, once said that he ""imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us."" We will keep fighting every day to realize a righteous world. #HarveyMilkDay"
"The Big Five defense contractors have too much power over the Pentagon. That’s why we need to pass basic ethics rules for the Department of Defense. Let’s make sure that all our national security decisions are driven not by special interests, but by what keeps Americans safe."
"Wow, that looks great Meaghan! (I have to say, the cardboard cut-out was a nice touch.) Right now our team is organizing #WinWithWarren debate watch parties across the country next month. RSVP to one near you:"
Bailey was a bad boy this morning. But at least he’s sorry.
"When I called Nicholas after he made a small donation, he knew it was me right away! We’re both fired up about living wages, so we talked about @SEIU’s fight to raise the minimum wage to $15. We need to do better by America’s workers. #FightFor15"
I stand in solidarity with the @McDonalds workers who are fighting for a living wage and better working conditions. #FightFor15
Six children have died after being detained by @CBP. That’s six children too many. We need answers—now.
"Trump promised to bring our troops home, but now he’s willing to send thousands more to the Middle East. I'll fight to stop this administration from dragging us into another forever war."
"Thank you, Sarah, this is an amazing program! Working on campaigns should be accessible to all people. Keep fighting the good fight."
I've been fighting against this anti-consumer proposal for years—and I'm glad it's been delayed so that it can be rewritten. People shouldn't be locked into unreasonable contracts that they didn't negotiate and that limit their right to go to court.
"Everywhere I go, I talk about how we need to make big, structural change to solve the deep, systemic problems we face as a country. Take the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: We had a plan, we got organized, and we turned it into a reality."
"If we want to live in a world where our children have clean water to drink, then we need to take action now."
That’s exactly right. And I have a plan to open the door of opportunity for millions of Americans struggling with student loan debt. Read about it here:
"I’m ready to fight for you, Allison, and the millions of people across the country who are getting crushed by student loan debt. Let’s do this together. #CancelMyDebt"
It doesn’t have to be this way. And I have a plan to change it.

"Logan from Virginia chipped in $20 to our grassroots campaign, so I called to say thank you. We talked about the issue that pulled Logan in: Student loan debt."
"Next month is #PrideMonth, and our team is getting ready with new Pride t-shirts, tanks, and totes! Grab one for you or the people you love."
"I loved being in Kermit, a resilient West Virginia town hit hard by the opioid epidemic. A lot of people told me, “You’re in the reddest of the red here.” But I’m running to be president of all the United States."
"I joined @TJMShow and @rolandsmartin this morning to talk about my plan to cancel student loan debt for 42 million Americans. If we dream big and fight hard, we can take on structural racism and level the playing field for families across the country."
Trump's actions alienate us from our allies and empower Iran's hardliners. They raise the risk of conflict and make us less safe. Chaos and confusion isn't a strategy—it's a recipe for disaster. I won't let this administration drag us into another war in the Middle East.
"The #IranDeal was working, but Trump ripped it up anyway—over the advice of his own national security team. For the last year, the administration has been goading and provoking the Iranian regime. Attempting to collapse their economy. Hinting at regime change."
I've read the intelligence. I attended yesterday’s briefing. The latest crisis with Iran didn't come out of thin air—it is a direct result of this president's actions.
I'm heartsick that five children have died after being detained by @CBP in the last six months. The American public is owed an explanation and a full account of what happened.
I do! Share your stories using #CancelMyDebt and find out how my plan to cancel student loan debt for 95% Americans that carry it would impact your life:  .
"Last week in Nashua, NH, we talked about how extremist Republicans think that this is their chance to overturn #RoeVWade. Not on our watch. We’ll keep fighting to #StopTheBans today and every day after it."
A single child dying in U.S. custody is horrific. Five is unfathomable. We need answers.
"Proud to see the people of Massachusetts making their voices heard and fighting for safe, legal abortion access and reproductive health care."
"I love #PrideMonth—and my team does too! Take a look at our new Pride t-shirts, tanks, and totes for you or the people you love. Can’t wait to get mine."
I stand with Brittany and the @McDonalds workers who are taking a stand against sexual harassment on the job and retaliation for reporting it. Workers with low wages are especially vulnerable to sexual harassment at work—and it has to stop. #TimesUp
"One in five American adults struggles with a mental health condition, but less than half of people who require treatment actually get it. Proud to be fighting with Rep. @joekennedy so that everyone gets the care they need."
"The time to act is now. Get into the fight, run for office, and make these right-wing Republican lawmakers face the consequences of their actions. Here’s my plan to protect reproductive health care and #StopTheBans:"
"Let’s be clear: #RoeVWade established a woman’s constitutional right to safe, legal abortion & has been the law of the land for over 46 years. An overwhelming majority of Americans don’t want to return to a world before Roe. But extremist Republicans are fighting to do just that."
I was glad when the House passed the #EqualityAct last week. But the fight for equality is not over—not when the Trump admin and extremist Republicans try to unravel LGBTQ+ Americans’ rights. I’m ready to keep fighting their attacks every step of the way.
"My #UniversalChildCare plan is personal. As a working mom, it was nearly impossible to find good child care—until my Aunt Bee stepped in. My plan guarantees high-quality child care for every child in America. It will be free for millions of families and affordable for everyone."

"Still thinking about the powerful town hall we had in Nashua yesterday. Big, structural change starts in rooms like this one!"
"Extremist lawmakers like Henry McMaster know that #RoeVWade is the law of the land, but they don’t care—they want to outlaw abortion. That’s why Congress must pass new federal laws to protect access to safe, legal abortion."
"See you again soon, Iowa!"
"You bet, Karenna! Climate change is a serious threat and we need to address it head on."
My thoughts are with Muhlaysia & her loved ones. A record number of trans Americans were killed last year—a number that disproportionately affects trans women of color. We must call it out & fight back so everyone is free to be who they are without fear.
"Look at the sign! Glad I got to spend time at River Road Tavern in Bedford, NH over the weekend."
"Dr. J.W. Endicott is a doctor in Kermit, WV who saw pharmaceutical companies squeeze his town to a breaking point. His story reminds me why we’re in this fight against the opioid epidemic."

Defense contractor influence is a big part of how we ended up with a bloated Pentagon budget that will cost more this year than Ronald Reagan spent at the height of the Cold War. It’s wasteful. It’s unsustainable. And it doesn’t keep us safe.
Our existing laws are far too weak to effectively limit the undue influence of giant military contractors at the Department of Defense. We need to change the rules.

—Shut the revolving door between giant contractors and the Pentagon
—Ban DoD officials from owning contractor stock
—Limit foreign government hiring of American national security officials
—Expose defense contractor lobbying"
"It’s wrong, wasteful, and bad for our national security. We have to call this what it is: corruption—plain and simple. I’ve already introduced a sweeping anti-corruption bill. Today, I introduced the Department of Defense Ethics and Anti-Corruption Act."
"It’s time to cut our bloated defense budget. And that influence is a big part of how we ended up with a Pentagon budget that'll cost more this year than we spend on education, medical research, housing, disaster relief—everything else in the discretionary budget put together."
"These giant contractors have deployed an extremely profitable strategy: First, recruit armies of lobbyists from former Pentagon officials and congressional staffers. Then, get those former officials to use their relationships, access, and influence to secure lucrative contracts."
"The coziness between defense lobbyists, Congress, and the Pentagon tilts countless decisions, big and small, away from legitimate national security interests and toward the desires of giant corporations that thrive off taxpayer dollars."
"Betsy DeVos hasn’t spent a day in the classroom teaching our students. I’m pledging to change that. Under a Warren administration, the Secretary of Education will be a former public school teacher."

Twenty-five men in the Alabama Senate passed this ban. Women across the country are watching and we will fight back.
You bet I have a plan for all that.

"We want to make it super easy for people to be #AllInForWarren and get in this fight—I hope you’ll sign up at  . Everyone owns a part of this campaign. If we dream big, fight hard, and work together, we can win in 2020."
I love the way that Rabiah and Tessa from our digital organizing team explain it: Think of it as the digital headquarters of this campaign.
"It’s important to me that everyone has equal access to this campaign, so we created a new digital community for supporters to join! #AllInForWarren is where campaign staff, volunteers, and supporters from all over the country can join forces:"
"Republican men are on a march toward overturning #RoeVWade. And thanks to Trump stacking the courts with anti-choice judges, they’re closer than ever. Women are scared, women are angry—and we have a right to be. If you’re an ally of women, now’s the time to make that clear."
"When I was growing up, people got abortions. Desperate women turned to back alley butchers or even tried the procedure on their own. Some were lucky, but others weren't. They all went through hell. Access to safe, legal abortion is a constitutional RIGHT. Full stop."
"Basic health care includes safe, legal abortion. Alabama’s backdoor abortion ban is an unconstitutional attack on women—an attack happening all across America. Let’s be very clear: We’re going to fight this ban and defend #RoeVWade. And we’ll win."
"We don’t have to choose between a green military and an effective one. My plan will improve our service members’ readiness and safety, and achieve cost savings for American taxpayers. Together, we can fight climate change—and win."
"The Pentagon is the single largest government consumer of energy, and it’s dependent on fossil fuels. To improve military readiness and help us achieve a #GreenNewDeal, the Pentagon should achieve net zero carbon emissions for all its non-combat bases and infrastructure by 2030."
"Today, I am introducing my Defense Climate Resiliency and Readiness Act to harden the U.S. military against the threat posed by climate change, and to leverage its huge energy footprint as part of our climate solution."
"Senior military leaders have warned Congress of the national security challenge that climate change poses. The military is taking steps to become more energy efficient and resilient. But instead of meeting this threat head on, Washington is ignoring it—and making it worse."
"Climate change is real, it’s worsening by the day, and it’s undermining our military readiness. More and more, accomplishing the mission depends on our ability to continue operations in the face of floods, drought, wildfires, desertification, and extreme cold."
"This ban is dangerous and exceptionally cruel—and the bill’s authors want to use it to overturn Roe v. Wade. I've lived in that America and let me tell you: We are not going back—not now, not ever. We will fight this. And we will win."
"Because of greedy pharmaceutical companies pumping drugs into town, Kermit, WV got hit hard by the opioid epidemic. I went there last week to say: Enough. I have a plan to end the opioid crisis and hold the people who caused it accountable."
"Right now, our government cares more about increasing the profitability of multinational corporations than American families. That’s why this grassroots campaign is all about returning the power to the people."
"Yesterday at Yards Brewing Co. in Philadelphia, I had the opportunity to thank grassroots donors for chipping in (and learn a little about brewing too)."
"Little by little, the Trump administration has chipped away at the Affordable Care Act and made it harder for people to get covered. It’s never been more important to protect the ACA and pass #MedicareForAll."
"Thank you, Liat. This is a campaign of ideas—and when we work together, we can make the kind of big, structural change our educational system needs."
"My three older brothers served in the military, so I know the responsibility we have to our service members, veterans, and their families. When we fail to provide them with a safe place to live, we’ve broken our promise to them."
"I won’t do a town hall with Fox News because I won’t invite millions of Democratic primary voters to tune in, inflate ratings, and help sell ads for an outlet that profits from racism and hate. If you agree, sign our petition."
"I’ve done 57 media avails and 131 interviews, taking over 1,100 questions from press just since January. Fox News is welcome to come to my events just like any other outlet. But a Fox News town hall adds money to the hate-for-profit machine. To which I say: hard pass."
"I’m running a campaign to reach all Americans. I take questions from the press and voters everywhere I go. I’ve already held town halls in 17 states and Puerto Rico—including WV, OH, GA, UT, TN, TX, CO, MS & AL."
Here’s one place we can fight back: I won’t ask millions of Democratic primary voters to tune into an outlet that profits from racism and hate in order to see our candidates—especially when Fox will make even more money adding our valuable audience to their ratings numbers.

But Fox News is struggling as more and more advertisers pull out of their hate-filled space. A Democratic town hall gives the Fox News sales team a way to tell potential sponsors it's safe to buy ads on Fox—no harm to their brand or reputation (spoiler: It’s not).
"Hate-for-profit works only if there’s profit, so Fox News balances a mix of bigotry, racism, and outright lies with enough legit journalism to make the claim to advertisers that it’s a reputable news outlet. It’s all about dragging in ad money—big ad money."
"Fox News is a hate-for-profit racket that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists—it’s designed to turn us against each other, risking life and death consequences, to provide cover for the corruption that’s rotting our government and hollowing out our middle class."
"I love town halls. I’ve done more than 70 since January, and I’m glad to have a television audience be a part of them. Fox News has invited me to do a town hall, but I’m turning them down—here’s why..."
Authoritarian tendencies. Gleefully undermining democracy. Corruption. No wonder Viktor Orbán was so warmly welcomed by Donald Trump yesterday.
"Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education we’ve seen. Instead of championing our students, she protects for-profit colleges that break the law. So I’m making a pledge: In a Warren administration, the Secretary of Education will be a former public school teacher."
I grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class. My family didn’t have money for a college application—let alone college. I dropped out of school at 19 to get married. My second chance was a commuter college that cost $50 a semester—and I hung on for dear life.
"When pharmaceutical CEOs pad their pockets and commit criminal negligence while pushing drugs, they should go to jail."
Family farmers across the country are being squeezed by the Trump administration’s terrible policies. Our farmers deserve better.
Feeling inspired after the #AFTVotes town hall this afternoon. I’ll always stand behind our teachers and their right to unionize. Thank you @AFTunion and @rweingarten for letting me be part of today’s powerful conversation.
Thank you for the questions and powerful conversation about teaching in America.
We need a Secretary of Education who actually cares about our teachers and students.
"In my administration, the Secretary of Education will be a former public school teacher who is committed to public education. Add your name if you agree that we need to replace Betsy DeVos with someone who actually fights for our kids."
"The next Secretary of Education should be a former public school teacher—someone who will fight for students and not for shady, for-profit colleges."
I’ll be speaking at the #AFTVotes town hall about how we can level the playing field for America’s public school teachers. Tune in at 4:30 PM ET today.
"And we need to make it easier to join a union. Unions give teachers—and all workers—power in negotiations over the long run. That's good for teachers, good for students, and good for making sure we put the resources we need directly into our schools."
"My Secretary of Education will be someone with real teaching experience, who understands how low pay, tattered textbooks and crumbling classrooms affect educators and students. Someone who understands the crushing burden of student debt and will fight back."
"But Betsy DeVos is just a symptom of a badly broken system. We’re up against powerful forces, and to win, we need big structural change. So here’s my plan: Under a Warren administration, the Secretary of Education will be a public school teacher."
"There's no greater example of how we're failing students and teachers than Betsy DeVos, the worst Secretary of Education we’ve seen. Appointed despite her conflicts of interest, she's spent her time protecting for-profit colleges that break the law and cheat students."
"America’s teachers are being crushed. Too many teachers are working multiple jobs, drowning in student debt, and struggling to teach on shoestring budgets and insulting salaries. America is failing our teachers—and when we fail our teachers, we fail our future."

"Ever since I was little, I wanted to be a teacher. My 2nd grade teacher, Mrs. Lee, was the first person to tell me that I could be a teacher too. And thanks to a high quality, public education, I did become a teacher. I want kids today to have the same opportunities I did."
"I want to make it clear during #MilitaryAppreciationMonth: Those who serve our country deserve a safe, affordable place to live—for themselves and their families. My plan to improve our military housing would protect families from abuse and hold private developers accountable."
"Big tech companies like Facebook have too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. And when they buy out their competition, they stifle innovation and face less pressure to protect our privacy. That's why we need to #BreakUpBigTech."
"We’ve had over 70 town halls and we do a selfie line after each one. Not only is it fun, it’s when I get to listen to people’s stories. I’m so glad I got to take my 20,000th selfie yesterday with Umeirra in Cincinnati."
"Black moms are dying from childbirth-related causes at rates 3-4 times higher than white moms—and structural racism is the root cause of this problem. We need to call it out, and then fight back."
"On #MothersDay, I’m thinking about Black and Brown moms in our country. Women of color are dying from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes at staggering rates and it is the direct result of institutional and structural racism. We need to call it out and address it head on."
"My mother didn’t have much, but she knew that her kids had a fighting chance to build a future. Today, not every family has that fighting chance. That’s what I’m fighting for to honor my mother, on Mother’s Day and every day."
"For a long time, I thought that was just a story about my mother. And then years later, I came to understand that it's a story about millions of Americans who—no matter how scared they are—reach down, dig deep, find it, and pull up what they need to take care of the family."
"I watched her while she pulled it together, put that dress on, put on her high heels, blew her nose, walked to Sears, and got a minimum wage job. And that minimum wage job saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family. That story is written on my heart."
"Spread out on the bed was a black dress. It was that one dress that every mom had—it only came out for weddings, funerals, and graduations. She kept saying, “We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house.” She’d never worked outside the home, and she was terrified."
"Happy #MothersDay! Today, I’m honoring my mother. One morning after my daddy’s heart attack, I remember standing in their bedroom. Her face was red and puffy, with wadded-up tissues next to her. We’d just lost our family station wagon. Our house was next."
"Yay! Thanks for coming today and taking a selfie with me, Umeirra."
"Communities in NH and across the country are getting squeezed by opioids. They’re fighting back, but they can’t do it alone. We need to step up, and I have a plan to provide real resources to the states and communities affected by the opioid crisis."
"The energy in Columbus last night made me feel grateful down to my bones. We're going to dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020."
Alabama’s anti-abortion bill is dangerous and unconstitutional. I’m grateful to the Democratic lawmakers who are fighting their hearts out to protect women’s rights to control our own bodies. I’m with you all the way.
"Earlier this week, I wanted to make sure I called some of the teachers who have donated to our campaign to thank them. #TeacherAppreciationWeek"
"This photo was taken the moment I asked people in the room if they knew someone or had been directly affected by the opioid epidemic. This crisis is hitting communities hard, & I'm grateful for the important conversation in Chillicothe. If we fight hard, we can fix this together."
"We need to call out the history of discrimination in education, and honor the role HBCUs play in our country. Thank you @BlavityPolitics for the opportunity."
"As folks came through the photo line after our town hall in Kermit, West Virginia, a few of them pressed notes into my hand. I took a moment as we left town to read them."
"Thank you to Kermit, West Virginia, for your warm hospitality today. This small but mighty town is fighting hard to hold massive corporations accountable for fueling the opioid crisis in their community—and I'm proud to join them in this fight."
"Ever since I was little, I wanted to be a teacher. My 2nd grade teacher, Mrs. Lee, was the first person to tell me that I could be a teacher too. And thanks to a high quality, public education, I did become a teacher. I want kids today to have the same opportunities I did."

Checking out the Kermit Public Library was fun. One day we might even be able to see a book about our country’s first woman president.
"Today, 191 people will die from a drug overdose. I’m in this fight for everyone who’s been caught in the grips of addiction, or knows someone who is. By holding drug companies accountable and giving communities the money and tools to fight addiction, we can end the opioid crisis."
"When a corporate executive is criminally negligent and people get hurt, that executive should face jail time."
"This crisis has been driven by greed, pure and simple, and it’s time to change that. I’ve got a plan to make these companies pay up to ensure every person gets the care they need."
"Here’s the truth: Fueling addiction is big business. The five companies being sued by Kermit earned $17 billion shipping prescription opioids to West Virginia during those few years, and their CEOs took home millions in bonuses and pay."
"This small but mighty town filed a lawsuit against the pharmacy and five of the wholesale drug distributors who exacerbated the crisis. And it’s just one of many similar lawsuits lodged by towns, counties, and states across the country."
"The companies shipping these pills repeatedly disregarded requirements to report suspicious patterns of behavior, and the state Board of Pharmacy failed to enforce its own rules. But Kermit is fighting back."
"Over a period of just a few years, this town of only 400 people was flooded with approximately 13 million prescription opioid pills— that’s more than 30,000 pills per resident—all delivered to a single local pharmacy ."
"Today, I went to Kermit, a small town along the Kentucky-West Virginia border that’s been hard-hit by the opioid epidemic — and not by accident. I’ll tell you why."
"The opioid epidemic is crushing communities across the country. My plan to fix it, the #CAREact, would provide $100 billion in federal funding directly to communities like Bethlehem, NH. That’s what’s needed to make sure every single person gets the treatment they need."
"Governor Sununu’s veto of paid family and medical leave is absolutely shameful. Without paid leave, too many people will have to choose between their families and their paychecks. I'm going to fight for paid family and medical leave for every family."
"Sen. Cruz’s new bill to eliminate the @CFPB would help the rich and powerful, and hurt American families. This agency has forced financial companies to return an estimated $12 billion to the people. I’ll keep fighting for it—like I have from the start."
"You bet I do.

This is the fight of our lives—the fight to level the playing field for working Americans and return the power to the people. Will you be a part of our grassroots movement?"
"My debt cancellation plan helps 42M lower-income & middle-class families—and we'll pay for it with a 2 cent tax on the 75,000 richest fortunes. It also invests $50B in HBCUs & Minority-Serving Institutions. Find out how much relief you'd receive here."
"My plan has broad public support, including from people who never had students loans or finished paying off their loans already. Americans are big-hearted—they recognize how this proposal would help millions of families and boost the economy for everyone."
"This is just part of my plan for ending the student debt crisis with broad student loan debt cancellation and universal free college. Since the release of my plan, people across America have described the incredible difference it could make in their lives."
"Bank lobbyists claimed that changing the bankruptcy rules for student loans would reduce costs. Instead, costs went up and private student lending exploded. It was great for banks and bad for students. Congress should pass our bill to change this law immediately."
"In 2005, Congress passed a bad bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to stay afloat—including by making it nearly impossible for people to get rid of student loans in bankruptcy. Today, @DickDurbin and I introduced a bill to change that."
We’re headed to West Virginia and Ohio this weekend. Hope to see you there (or at an upcoming organizing event near you).
"My proposal for an Ultra-Millionaire Tax on the largest fortunes in America would pay for plans like student loan debt cancellation, universal free college, universal child care, and ending the opioid epidemic. And we’d still have more than half a trillion dollars left over."
Checking out the Kermit Public Library was fun. One day we might even be able to see a book about our country’s first woman president.

"This is just part of my plan for ending the student debt crisis with broad student loan debt cancellation and universal free college. Since the release of my plan, people across America have described the incredible difference it could make in their lives."
"Bank lobbyists claimed that changing the bankruptcy rules for student loans would reduce costs. Instead, costs went up and private student lending exploded. It was great for banks and bad for students. Congress should pass our bill to change this law immediately."
"In 2005, Congress passed a bad bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to stay afloat—including by making it nearly impossible for people to get rid of student loans in bankruptcy. Today, @DickDurbin and I introduced a bill to change that."
We’re headed to West Virginia and Ohio this weekend. Hope to see you there (or at an upcoming organizing event near you).
"My proposal for an Ultra-Millionaire Tax on the largest fortunes in America would pay for plans like student loan debt cancellation, universal free college, universal child care, and ending the opioid epidemic. And we’d still have more than half a trillion dollars left over."
"Nikita is a #TeamWarren volunteer in Utah who cares deeply about our environment and the urgency of climate change. I’m so grateful that she got in this fight. Sign up to volunteer, too:"
"I have a plan to make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition — and it starts with breaking up Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Learn more:"
"Chris Hughes is right. Today’s big tech companies have too much power—over our economy, our society, & our democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses & stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech."
Our democracy is broken. But I’ve got a plan—a lot of them!—to fix our government and give power back to the people. We can only do this together. Will you pitch in and join our movement? You might even get a call from me to say thanks.
"Yesterday, Mitch McConnell stepped onto the Senate floor saying “case closed” on the Mueller report.

I don’t think so."
The student loan debt crisis in America falls hardest on Black students and their families. My plan for student debt cancellation addresses that head on.
"The #CAREact is modeled after the Ryan White CARE Act, which—after a long fight—provided significant funding to help communities combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We need that kind of big, structural change to tackle the opioid epidemic today."
"Real, structural change to address the opioid epidemic is going to take new leadership in Washington. If you’re with me in the fight to end this crisis, add your name and become a citizen co-sponsor of the #CAREact."
"Nearly two decades into the 21st century—in the wealthiest country in the world—American life expectancy went down, and it’s largely driven by the opioid epidemic. The #CAREact gives us a fighting chance at ending the crisis and saving lives."
"A year ago the Trump administration began its immoral family separation policy. Yesterday, the artist and activist @paolamendoza’s installation in front of the capitol building was a powerful reminder: We won’t stop fighting #UntilEveryFamilyIsReunited."
Let’s be clear: #HB1264 is nothing more than Governor Sununu’s attempt to impose a poll tax on college students to make it harder for them to make their voices heard. Gov. Sununu should listen to the people.
"Let’s be clear: This bill, and others across the country like it, put women in danger. Women should have the right to control our own bodies. We won’t go back. Not now—not ever."
"Under my plan, billionaires that got rich off of this crisis would pay to help ensure every person gets the care they need. And under my Corporate Executive Accountability Act, executives who deliberately hurt people through criminal negligence will face real criminal penalties."
"That's a start. But this crisis has been driven by greed, pure and simple. To solve it, we need to hold business executives that cheat, defraud, and addict people accountable."
"The CARE Act also works to strengthen our addiction treatment infrastructure—demanding states use Medicaid to its fullest to tackle the crisis, expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, and ensuring treatment programs and recovery residences meet high standards."
"These resources would support the whole continuum of care, from early intervention, to harm reduction, to long-term support services. They would ensure access to mental health services and help provide critical wraparound services like housing support and medical transportation."
"Today, Rep. Cummings & I—along with 80+ cosponsors—are rolling out the CARE Act, a comprehensive plan to end the opioid crisis by providing states & communities $100 billion over the next 10 years to ensure every single person gets the treatment they need."
"70,000 Americans died in 2017 from a drug overdose—the majority due to opioids. Emergency room visits for opioid overdoses are skyrocketing, and too many are still not receiving treatment. This is a public health crisis. And it has also severely impacted communities of color."
"Heartsick for the victims, their loved ones, and the Highlands Ranch community. How many more of our children’s schools must be torn apart by gun violence until Congress does something? We need gun reform. Now."
Tonight I’ll be on @allinwithchris to talk about how it’s never been more important to defend our constitution and fight for our democracy. Tune in to @MSNBC at 8 PM ET!

"There are three inescapable facts from the Mueller report that Mitch McConnell can't hide:
1. A foreign government attacked our elections in order to help Donald Trump.
2. Trump welcomed that help.
3. Trump tried to obstruct the investigation into his actions."
Mitch McConnell is protecting and defending Donald Trump—not our Constitution or democracy. Congress needs to do its job and start impeachment proceedings now.
Mitch McConnell took the same oath of office as I did: To protect and defend the Constitution of the United States—not to protect and defend Donald Trump. Every elected official should read the Mueller report. Then Congress should do its job and begin impeachment proceedings.
Looks like a great walk—wish Bruce and I could have joined with Bailey! #WinWithWarren
My plan would wipe out student loan debt for millions of Americans—and I’ve got a calculator to show you how much you’d save.
"Any efforts to address climate change must include our public lands. That’s why on the first day of a Warren administration, I will sign  a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases, including for drilling offshore and on public lands."
"Our grassroots team is growing! Over half of our staff is on the ground in the early primary and caucus states, and I need your help to keep up the momentum. Chip in $5, or whatever you can, to power this grassroots campaign."
Somebody’s ready for spring.
Ramadan Mubarak! Bruce and I send our wishes for a blessed and meaningful month for all who observe.
"My 2nd grade teacher, Mrs. Lee, told me that if I worked hard, I could be a teacher, too. That changed my world, and I’m still grateful. Thank you to our teachers across the country who fight every day so that our kids have the opportunity to succeed. #TeacherAppreciationWeek"
"Last week, I re-introduced legislation that would provide Puerto Rico with a path to comprehensive debt relief. We won’t stop fighting until the people of Puerto Rico get the respect they deserve. Add your name here to say you’re with me on this:"
I heard you loud and clear! Baby onesies are available on our online store (perfect for your pint-sized persisters).
"Dominic, Kanu, Morgan, and Madeline all have big goals they want to reach—but student loan debt is holding them back. It’s time to address this problem head on, and that’s what my new plan does."
It does! And you can see exactly how much debt would be cancelled by using my new calculator:
Sixty-four percent of Florida voters approved an amendment to their state constitution that would restore voting rights to ex-felons—but Republicans are working hard to undermine the will of the people. It’s outrageous.
".@JulianCastro is right—no person is illegal, and our laws should reflect that. I admire his smart ideas on reforming our immigration laws. We should all pay attention to them."
Our grassroots movement is growing in South Carolina. Follow @SCforWarren for #TeamWarren updates from SC and information on how to join our fight. Let’s do this together!
"Thank you, Osage and Mason City! Had a powerful conversation today about how we can level the playing field for working families in Iowa—and across the country."
"I'm thrilled that the courts are holding Republicans accountable for their disgraceful partisan gerrymandering. But if we truly want to break their grip on power, we'll need to elect Dems across the country, up and down the ballot *before* redistricting."
It’s possible! Let’s keep growing our movement to make it a reality.

I’ve got a plan to cancel student loan debt for over 95% of Americans with student loans—and a calculator to help you figure out how much of your debt would be cancelled. Try it out and let me know how it goes!
"Dreaming big, fighting hard, and living proud!"
Grateful down to my toes for every single person in this movement. Let’s keep fighting hard!
"Yesterday, I stopped by our Win With Warren organizing house party in Iowa Falls—and oh boy, was there some great energy in the room. Iowa is in this fight all the way."
"Women should be able to control our own bodies. Our rights aren’t just threatened in Alabama —all across the country, safe, legal abortion access is under attack. You bet I’ll keep fighting to protect it."
"Thank you, Ames!"
How much of your student loan debt could get canceled under my new plan? Give our new calculator a try:   #CancelMyDebt
No one understands Iowa Democratic politics quite like Jan Bauer does. I’m grateful we had the opportunity to chat today about this grassroots fight and the work she does to grow this movement!
"John Kelly pushed for family separation while in the White House. Now he'll profit off of separating mamas from their babies. It’s immoral, and under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow it would be illegal for someone like Kelly to do this."
"It was great talking to you, @ZachWahls. I’m inspired by your dedication to the people of Iowa."
"HBCUs have had to do more with less, and that’s wrong. We need to call out the discrimination that led us to this point, and we need to live up to our obligations. That means we need to start investing in HBCUs."
I've got a plan to cancel student loan debt for 42 million Americans—and we've got a new calculator to help you figure out how much of your debt would be cancelled. Give it a try & tell us how much of your student loan debt will be cancelled. #CancelMyDebt
"Right now, Wall Street is squeezing Puerto Rico. We must do better by our fellow U.S. citizens. That’s why I have a plan to provide comprehensive debt relief to Puerto Rico so it can rebuild and thrive."
"Grace, I’m so glad to have you on our team."
"The flooding across eastern Iowa is just one example of how climate change is affecting us in real time. It’s our moral obligation to fight for our planet before it’s too late. Thank you for stepping up and helping the community, Karen!"
"A hostile foreign power attacked our democracy. The president welcomed that attack, obstructed the investigation into it, & is now cozying up with the leader who orchestrated it. Congress needs to do its job, stand up for our national security, and begin impeachment proceedings."
"Health care is a human right, and we fight for human rights. #MedicareForAll"
Grace from New Hampshire is absolutely right. My new plan to cancel student debt for 95% of Americans and make public college free would level the playing field for all of our students—not just a select few.
"About a third of US student loan debt is held by people over the age of 40. The student loan debt crisis is a burden on all of us, and my plan to cancel debt for 95% of Americans with student loan debt helps everyone get ahead."
"Candidates for president don’t always go to Utah or Tennessee or Alabama because they aren’t battleground states. But this is a 50-state campaign, and I'm traveling to every corner of our country because I’m running to be president of the entire United States."

"On Yom HaShoah, we pause to remember the millions of victims of the Holocaust. This year, Remembrance Day falls in the shadow of yet another attack on a synagogue. We must keep fighting anti-Semitism, bigotry, racism, and hate."
"I missed Shannon on the first try, and then I saw her tweet asking to call her back—so I did. I’m deeply grateful for Shannon and her dedication to this grassroots movement."
"En Estados Unidos, se necesita un liderazgo que respete a todos sus ciudadanos—y en el caso de Puerto Rico, el respeto significa poner las vidas de millones de ciudadanos por encima de los márgenes de ganancia de Wall Street."
Puerto Rico shows us a clear example of how well the federal government works for Wall Street and how poorly it works for everyone else. I believe we should fight back—and treat Puerto Rico with respect.
"Crippling student loan debt is holding families back. My new plan would change that for Valerie from South Carolina, and millions of other Americans across the country."
Esta legislación establecería una avenida para el alivio comprensivo de la deuda de Puerto Rico. Puedes leer todos los detalles aquí.
Los ejecutivos de Wall Street ven la desesperación en la isla como una oportunidad para obtener ganancias—y eso me da asco. Por eso estoy presentado nuevamente el Acta de Alivio para los Territorios Estadounidenses.
"El Congreso tuvo la oportunidad de romper con el control de Wall Street. En vez de hacerlo, aprobaron una legislación llamada PROMESA, estableciendo una junta de supervisión fiscal que exigió recortes a servicios básicos, coartando la posibilidad de recuperación para PR."
"Sin embargo, por causa de su estatus único, esas avenidas legales no están a su alcance. Gran parte de la deuda está en manos de Wall Street, quienes intentan exprimir hasta el último centavo de ganancia."
"Si Puerto Rico fuera una corporación grande o una ciudad en los Estados Unidos en este tipo de crisis financiera, podría declararse en bancarrota: pagando parte de su deuda, liquidando el resto y así comenzar a reconstruir."
"Los huracanes Irma y María devastaron a Puerto Rico y a los millones de ciudadanos estadounidenses que viven en la isla. Queda claro que la respuesta de la administración de Trump fue inefectiva, pero una de las mayores limitaciones frenando la recuperación recae en su deuda."
Wall Street executives see the island’s desperation as just another opportunity to make a profit—and it makes me sick. That’s why I’m re-introducing the U.S. Territorial Relief Act to provide Puerto Rico with a path to comprehensive debt relief.
"Much of Puerto Rico’s debt is held by Wall Street, which is trying to squeeze out every last penny of profit. Congress had a chance to break Wall Street's grip. Instead, they passed PROMESA, imposing an oversight board which has slashed services, hindering the recovery."
"If Puerto Rico were a big company or an American city in this kind of financial trouble, it could file for bankruptcy, pay some of its debts, discharge the rest, then start rebuilding. But because of its unique status, those legal options aren’t available."
Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the millions of U.S. citizens who live there. The Trump Administration's response was slow and ineffective—but one of the biggest constraints holding back the recovery has been Puerto Rico's debt.
"My three big brothers served in the military: Don Reed and John joined the Air Force, and David joined the Army. I’m glad I got to talk with and listen to military families in Nevada on Saturday. They deserve better and you bet I’m going to keep fighting for them."
"Hate has no place in our country. The threat of white nationalism is real. And when I'm president, the Justice Department will prosecute domestic terrorists to the full extent of the law."
"The American people know we must take bold steps to address our student debt crisis. By asking the top 0.1% to pay their fair share, we can cancel student loans for 42 million Americans. That wouldn’t just help our students, it would help all of us."
"Unions built the middle class, and unions will rebuild the middle class. I’m grateful I got the chance to talk with @SEIU members in Nevada last weekend."

"Donald Trump isn’t king, and no one is above the law. We know Barr's deceptive ""summary"" was intended to protect the man in the White House, and Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the President."
This is outrageous. We need answers on how @DHSgov obtained surveillance data from family separation protests and how that data was used.
"AG Barr is a disgrace, and his alarming efforts to suppress the Mueller report show that he's not a credible head of federal law enforcement. He should resign—and based on the actual facts in the Mueller report, Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the President."
"It’s Bailey’s 1st birthday! Bruce and I are so grateful for this sweetie and the gentleness he brings into our lives. Happy birthday, boy. You make my heart happy."
"On #MayDay, I’m thinking about our country’s long history of workers making their voices heard and demanding change—just like the Lawrence, MA mill workers did over a century ago. The Bread and Roses strike inspires me to this day, and reminds us to keep fighting for our rights."
"I've read the Mueller report, and one thing is very clear: Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetime, and Congress should begin impeachment proceedings. No one is above the law. Not even the President."

This is a campaign of ideas—and you bet I have a lot of them. It’s about identifying what’s broken and how we’re going to make the structural change to fix it.
Some giant companies make billions of dollars in profits but pay $0 in corporate income tax. My Real Corporate Profits Tax would make big and profitable companies pay their fair share and ensure none of them ever pay zero taxes again.
"Thank you, Ady. I’m so grateful to call you my friend. We’re in this fight together."
"Karen from New Hampshire has seen first hand how students are getting crushed by mountains of student loan debt. By making public colleges free and canceling student debt for 95% of Americans, we’ll do good by our students and our economy."

I’m not taking PAC money or donations from federal lobbyists. I’m also not schmoozing with wealthy donors behind closed doors. That’s why I need your help. Help hit our April fundraising goal and chip in to our Official 2020 Campaign.
Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes. A major reason? Racism. It's time to hold health systems accountable for protecting Black moms.
Covering our eyes won't change the facts. It's long past time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan.
"Since today is Bailey’s birthday, here’s a little something to celebrate! Our team has Bailey-themed bandanas and a lot more at our online store:"
"May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month—an important time to honor #AAPI Americans and their history. I’m grateful for the AAPI leaders across the country who are driving the fight for big, structural change in their communities. #APAHM"
"Donald Trump isn’t king, and no one is above the law. We know Barr's deceptive ""summary"" was intended to protect the man in the White House, and Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the President."
This is outrageous. We need answers on how @DHSgov obtained surveillance data from family separation protests and how that data was used.
"AG Barr is a disgrace, and his alarming efforts to suppress the Mueller report show that he's not a credible head of federal law enforcement. He should resign—and based on the actual facts in the Mueller report, Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the President."
"It’s Bailey’s 1st birthday! Bruce and I are so grateful for this sweetie and the gentleness he brings into our lives. Happy birthday, boy. You make my heart happy."
"On #MayDay, I’m thinking about our country’s long history of workers making their voices heard and demanding change—just like the Lawrence, MA mill workers did over a century ago. The Bread and Roses strike inspires me to this day, and reminds us to keep fighting for our rights."
"I've read the Mueller report, and one thing is very clear: Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetime, and Congress should begin impeachment proceedings. No one is above the law. Not even the President."
"I'm heartsick for the victims of the #UNCC shooting and their family, friends, and classmates. Schools should be a safe haven for students and faculty, but again we see a horrific act of violence on a school campus. Enough is enough."

"Our democracy is not for sale, and neither is my time. That’s why this campaign is powered by grassroots donors. We have less than 48 hours to hit our April fundraising goal—will you chip in what you can?"
"It was great to be in Las Vegas again this weekend to talk about how we’re going to fight for big, structural change. See you again soon!"
"She used to lobby for a Ukrainian oligarch. Now the Trump administration wants to give her a plum job at the Treasury Department. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, it’d be illegal for former lobbyists like her to work for our government."
What would it be like to have a woman in the White House? I think it’d be great—and the crowd in Cedar Rapids last week agreed.
Women should be able to control our own bodies. Full stop.
Outrageous. Filing taxes should be simple and free. Big financial corporations like TurboTax shouldn’t be able to scam consumers like this—and my Tax Simplification Act would fix that.
"For most candidates, “call time” means calling wealthy donors and asking for money. Not me. I’m spending “call time” thanking small-dollar, grassroots donors who give what they can. Chip in what you can, and you might get a call from me to say thank you:"
Busy weekend in Iowa and Nevada. Somebody was waiting for me to come home!
Unions built America’s middle class and unions will rebuild America’s middle class. Thanks @SEIU and @CAPAction for inviting me to speak at the #WorkersForum!
"Thank you, Iowa, for the warm welcome and for helping make Bruce’s birthday weekend truly special! We look forward to seeing you again soon."
I was proud to take the #WeAreIndivisible pledge—now let's do the work we need to do to defeat Trump in 2020.
"I'm heartsick for the victims of today's horrific attack at the Chabad of Poway and their families. No one should ever have to face hatred and violence in a place of worship. It's on all of us to stand up to the rising threat of anti-semitism, racism, and hate."
"As I told @JoyAnnReid, we've got to get organized, get mobilized, and build a grassroots movement if we want to make big, structural change. And we'll need a president who is willing to fight for it every inch of the way."
"On her birthday, we remember activist and civil rights hero Coretta Scott King. Her powerful voice continues to resonate across the country—and we will never let anyone silence it. Nevertheless, we persist."

"I ordered him a huge lunch, and he wolfed down every bite. At the end, he said he loved it. Right then, I knew this was a guy I could live with forever. This week we were back in Houston for She the People, and we went back to Ninfa’s."
"The first time Bruce came to Houston to meet my family, I picked him up at the airport and drove him directly to my favorite Tex-Mex place, Ninfa’s on Navigation. He’d grown up in Massachusetts and everything in this part of the world was new."
"Today is Bruce's birthday, so yesterday we celebrated with cake. I’m very lucky to have him by my side this weekend in Iowa—and for all of life’s big adventures. Happy birthday, Bruce!"

"Universal child care. Affordable housing. Student loan debt cancellation and universal free college. Yup, I’ve got a plan for that—and more."
"Coastal communities have made it clear: No more offshore drilling that hurts our planet. On day one of a Warren administration, I promise to sign a total moratorium on new offshore drilling."
"This week at @_shethepeople, I was asked if I’m afraid voters will think white male candidates are “safer” than voting for a woman.

I’m not afraid—not by a long shot."
"Today, I’m thinking about the Iowans whose lives were torn apart by intense flooding this spring, and the first responders who are helping keep people safe. Climate change is real—and we need big, structural change to tackle it head on."
"Yesterday’s meet and greet in Linn County was a meaningful one. People are fired up for big, structural change."
"Today I’m rolling out a plan to improve our military housing, protect families from abuse, and hold private developers accountable. The very least we owe those who proudly defend our country and their families is a safe, affordable place to live."
"Military families have been living with lead paint, faulty wiring, ceilings collapsing, and mice infestations. Mold has taken over entire rooms. Kids are getting sick from living in these homes. That's not how we should treat our servicemembers—and it needs to stop now."
"A handful of private developers have taken over 99% of domestic military family housing. Driven by short-term payoffs and with no meaningful oversight, contractors have failed to maintain the homes they were entrusted with—and families are suffering the consequences."

Donald Trump’s White House is a product of a system that’s rigged in favor of the rich and the powerful. But this is our time to change that. Join our fight to win in 2020 and return the power to the people:

We have to right the wrongs for communities of color. And that starts by addressing the legacy of discrimination in our country.
Black moms in our country are dying from childbirth-related causes 3-4 times more often than white moms. Any meaningful solution to our maternal mortality crisis must address structural racism as a root cause of this problem. My new idea would tackle this crisis head on.
"Grateful to be part of such a powerful conversation at #SheThePeople2020 this afternoon. Our country needs to do better by women of color—and for me, it starts with addressing and tackling the Black maternal mortality crisis head on."
"We've done this in other areas of health care. Let's do it here. If providers deliver quality care to Black moms, they’ll make more. If they don’t, they’ll make less. Don't just observe and debate racism in health care. Make providers pay until this crisis is fixed. #SheThePeople"
Advocates are forcing Black maternal mortality into the conversation. There are important ideas on the table. Here's mine: Hit health care providers in their wallets. Make it unacceptable for providers to tolerate our high rates of moms dying—especially Black moms. #SheThePeople
The evidence all points in the same direction. The mistreatment of Black and Brown women around maternal health is the direct result of institutional and structural racism. We need bold solutions to the epidemic of maternal mortality in America. #SheThePeople
"Moms in our country are dying from childbirth at rates almost 40% higher than in other wealthy countries—and the Black maternal mortality rate is 3-4 times higher than it is for white moms, across all income levels. We have to call it out. #SheThePeople"
"The treatment of women and infants is a direct reflection of the values of a society—and the U.S. has the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world. It's a national disgrace. Today, I talked about my idea to fix it. #SheThePeople"
"Student loan debt is holding back an entire generation and crushing families—but we can change that. José María, Eva, Jayme, Alexandria, Tasha, Alicia, and Michael have big plans for what they could do if we cancel their debt."

It was great meeting Ricardo at @AllenUniv in South Carolina yesterday. I’m grateful that young people like him are in this fight all the way to cancel debt for 95% of Americans and make public colleges free.
"Young people in our country, like Aubrey from Utah, are getting absolutely crushed by student loan debt. It doesn’t have to be this way and I’ve got a plan to tackle the debt crisis head on."
"I want every girl to grow up knowing that they can fight from the heart—and that they can win. So when I meet a little girl on the campaign trail, I say: “I’m running for president, because that’s what girls do.” And we pinky promise that they’ll remember."
"When Amazon can tilt the online marketplace in its own favor, small businesses see an immediate impact in their profits. That can be absolutely crushing, it's not fair, and I’m fighting to end that."
"Finally, I said that Amazon was about 49% of all online retail sales. And yes, you are. What an odd thing to deliberately misconstrue."
"Second, Amazon's private label products are projected to reach $25 billion in online sales by 2022. An analyst said huge private label sales would give Amazon ""a strong...competitive advantage"":"
"Oh boy. Here are the facts:
First, there are multiple reports that Amazon is using the data it collects to copy successful goods sold by small businesses on the Amazon Marketplace and sell its own branded version."
"Let’s be clear: Our #2020census must count every single person. Our Constitution demands it, and our democracy requires it."
"My new plan for the cancellation of student loan debt applies to public technical schools, too. Wherever you pursue an education, you should be able to graduate without getting crushed by piles of debt."
"Thanks, @NHYoungDems. I’m grateful for the work you do on this issue, including pushing NH to restore funding for public universities."
"You've got to pay something back so that everyone can have a chance. A 2% tax on the wealthiest fortunes can let us provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, cancel student loan debt for 95% of Americans—and still have a trillion dollars left over. #WarrenTownHall"
"I was grateful to be at @AllenUniv this morning, where we talked about how we can level the playing field for all our students—not just a select few. My new college debt plan would establish a minimum of $50 billion for HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions."
"We can make big, structural change—as long as we build a grassroots movement to fight for it. Add your name to say you support cancelling up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans and making universal free public college a reality."
"Our government needs to do right by Americans getting crushed by debt—including you, Sarah. I’m in this fight to end the student debt crisis all the way."
"I know we can make real, structural change for students like you, Olyvia. That’s what my new plan is all about."
"Do you have a story about student loan debt and college affordability? How would this plan change your life? If this plan would be personally meaningful for you or someone you know, raise your voice and tell your story with #CancelMyDebt."
"My new plan would cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans, and completely wipe out student loan debt for more than 75% of Americans. This would free an entire generation of families from crushing debt and give our economy a boost."
Even better: I want to establish a *minimum* of $50 billion for HBCUs & Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)! The Secretary of Ed. would increase the amount of money in the fund as needed to ensure that spending per-student at these schools is comparable to colleges in the area.
This is personal because policy touches the lives of everyone in this country. Thanks for tuning in! #WarrenTownHall

"When Amazon can tilt the online marketplace in its own favor, small businesses see an immediate impact in their profits. That can be absolutely crushing, it's not fair, and I’m fighting to end that."
"Finally, I said that Amazon was about 49% of all online retail sales. And yes, you are. What an odd thing to deliberately misconstrue."
"Second, Amazon's private label products are projected to reach $25 billion in online sales by 2022. An analyst said huge private label sales would give Amazon ""a strong...competitive advantage"":"
"Oh boy. Here are the facts:
First, there are multiple reports that Amazon is using the data it collects to copy successful goods sold by small businesses on the Amazon Marketplace and sell its own branded version."
"Let’s be clear: Our #2020census must count every single person. Our Constitution demands it, and our democracy requires it."
"My new plan for the cancellation of student loan debt applies to public technical schools, too. Wherever you pursue an education, you should be able to graduate without getting crushed by piles of debt."
"Thanks, @NHYoungDems. I’m grateful for the work you do on this issue, including pushing NH to restore funding for public universities."
"You've got to pay something back so that everyone can have a chance. A 2% tax on the wealthiest fortunes can let us provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, cancel student loan debt for 95% of Americans—and still have a trillion dollars left over. #WarrenTownHall"
"I was grateful to be at @AllenUniv this morning, where we talked about how we can level the playing field for all our students—not just a select few. My new college debt plan would establish a minimum of $50 billion for HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions."
"We can make big, structural change—as long as we build a grassroots movement to fight for it. Add your name to say you support cancelling up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans and making universal free public college a reality."
"Our government needs to do right by Americans getting crushed by debt—including you, Sarah. I’m in this fight to end the student debt crisis all the way."
"I know we can make real, structural change for students like you, Olyvia. That’s what my new plan is all about."
"Do you have a story about student loan debt and college affordability? How would this plan change your life? If this plan would be personally meaningful for you or someone you know, raise your voice and tell your story with #CancelMyDebt."
"My new plan would cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans, and completely wipe out student loan debt for more than 75% of Americans. This would free an entire generation of families from crushing debt and give our economy a boost."
Even better: I want to establish a *minimum* of $50 billion for HBCUs & Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs)! The Secretary of Ed. would increase the amount of money in the fund as needed to ensure that spending per-student at these schools is comparable to colleges in the area.

"That’s why I’m proposing a historic new federal investment in public higher education that will eliminate the cost of tuition and fees at every public two-year and four-year college in America, plus an additional $100 billion investment in Pell Grants."
"I was able to get a quality, public education for just $50 a semester. That kind of opportunity is virtually impossible to find today. As states have invested less in community colleges and public four-year colleges, schools have raised tuition and fees to make up the gap."

"To ignore a President’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways."

"It really was a terrific shirt. Thank you for fighting the good fight, Hollis!"
"Bradley, the honor was mine. Thank you for being in this fight!"
Glad I got a chance to meet them!
"Glad we got to meet, Charli!"
"Thank you, Denver!"

"Early morning walk in Denver before we head to Utah. See you soon, Salt Lake City!"
"Our pop-up event yesterday at Lady Justice Brewery—a great small business in Denver, Colorado—was a lot of fun. We had an important conversation about how we can protect our environment for generations to come. We're going to do this together!"
"We need big, structural change—like my new public lands idea—to tackle climate change and protect our planet before it’s too late. You can read more about our new idea here:"
Woo-hoo! The crowd in Denver is fired up. I’m grateful to have all of you in this grassroots movement. See you soon.
"I believe we have a moral obligation to protect our public lands. We owe it to our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come."
"Unions built the middle class, and unions will rebuild the middle class. I stand with the 31K @stopandshop workers who are making their voices heard, and fighting for better wages and working conditions."
"I will always stand with our trans service members. If someone can handle the job, they should be allowed to serve—no exceptions. We’ll fight this tooth and nail."
"Still smiling over the warm welcome I received in Beaufort yesterday. I agree—it’s about time we have a woman president. (That kettle corn was amazing, by the way!)"
"Climate change is an existential threat. There is no Planet B for us. At our house party in Lebanon, NH this weekend, I talked about how we need to protect our environment—and my new ideas to protect public lands is a step in that direction."
"My big new idea bans new fossil fuel drilling offshore and on public lands, generates more renewable energy, establishes free entry to all national parks, and more. Sign our petition if you support more protection for public lands."
I stand with @PittGrads as they make their voices heard this week.
"This list shouldn’t be this long—heck, there shouldn't be a list in the first place. Under my Real Corporate Profits Tax, giant corporations like these wouldn’t be able to get away with paying $0 in income taxes."
"I’m grateful to the people of Charleston, South Carolina for welcoming me into their community yesterday. We had important conversations at our Coastal Community Forum about climate change and more."
Presidential candidates don’t always go to Utah because it isn't a battleground state. But I’ll be there this week because I’m running to be president of the entire United States. Join us and let’s do this together.

"Thank you for honoring the fight for fair wages and better benefits, @Teamsters."
America’s public lands belong to everyone—so we should start acting like it. Read my full plan here:
"I agree, and I’m grateful for the @sunrisemvmt’s leadership in the fight for our environment. My new plan for public lands is an essential part of any #GreenNewDeal. We're in this fight together."
"Thank you, Charleston! Had a great time talking about the big, structural change our movement is fighting for."
I called for an investigation into Bernhardt’s conflicts of interests as a lobbyist-turned Acting Interior Secretary. The American people shouldn’t have to wonder if their government is working to protect them from climate change—or working for big corporations. Time for answers.
It’s time to make America’s public lands part of our climate change solution. That means we need to stop corporations from pillaging our public lands and leaving taxpayers to clean up the mess. My new idea puts our environment and our communities first.
"America’s public lands belong to all of us. We should start acting like it. That means expanding access, ending fossil fuel extraction, more renewables, and maintaining and improving public lands. Together, we can protect our public lands for generations to come."
"Trump is selling off public lands to oil, gas, and coal companies. It's wrong. Let's end it and make our public lands part of the climate solution—with a total moratorium on new fossil fuel drilling and a plan to get 10% of America's energy from renewables on these lands instead."
"America’s public lands provide us with clean air and water, sustain fish and wildlife, and offer a place for millions to experience the beauty of nature. Right now, they're under attack. Read my new plan to protect them while fighting climate change:"
"No matter what you end up paying on #TaxDay, it’s more than what Amazon—which makes billions in profits—paid last year. Learn more about how my Real Corporate Profits tax would require billion-dollar corporations to pay their fair share."
"Sara Mae was one of the first women to ever run in the #BostonMarathon (and fight for women to be allowed to compete in the first place). When I first ran for Senate, she was also one of my first grassroots supporters. Here’s why she’s in this fight all the way."
"Happy #PatriotsDay! Bruce, Bailey, and I are wishing good luck to everyone running in the #BostonMarathon today."
"Today marks six years since the Boston Marathon bombings. On #OneBostonDay, we remember the victims, survivors, and brave first responders—and honor the resilience of the city of Boston. #BostonStrong"
Too late to audition to be a direwolf?
"We had powerful conversations in Hanover and Concord yesterday about the future of our country. The environment, #MedicareForAll, education—we’re fighting our hearts out for it."
"I want this movement to know that I’m grateful for their support—so yesterday, I FaceTimed into some #WinWithWarren parties like this one in Grand Rapids, Michigan to say thanks. (Don’t worry, Bruce was keeping his eyes on the road the whole time.)"
"I ended my day in a perfect way: At a #WinWithWarren organizing house party in Londonderry. It was packed with grassroots supporters who are ready to roll up their sleeves and start fighting for big, structural change in our country. That’s what this campaign is all about."
"Thank you, Wade! I’m so glad to have you in this fight. #WinWithWarren"
"Thank you, Karl!"
Sounds like a great get-together! (P.S. text FIGHT to 24477 and you might just get a Bailey photo too). #WinWithWarren

"Wow—hello right back to you! Texas has a special place in my heart, and I’m glad to see you growing our grassroots movement there, Katherine. #WinWithWarren"
"Today we launched hundreds of #WinWithWarren house parties across the country—from New Hampshire to Oklahoma to Nevada. These parties are all about getting organized and keeping up the momentum so we can create big, structural change. Find one near you:"
"Good luck, Mara! Thank you so much for hosting. #WinWithWarren"
"Thank you for hosting a #WinWithWarren party, Andrea! Love those flowers."
"I’m so glad to have your support, Maysoon."
"Just wrapped up our house party in Lebanon, New Hampshire! This weekend, people all around the country are participating in #WinWithWarren organizing house parties to talk about how we can build a real grassroots movement together."
The environment. LGBTQ+ rights. Health care. Education. We’re going to tackle these issues head on—and it all starts at #WinWithWarren organizing house parties like this one. RSVP to participate in a party near you:
"Thank you for hosting, Pastor Kathy! #WinWithWarren"
"Yay! Thank you, Angela. #WinWithWarren"
"Thanks so much for stepping up and hosting a #WinWithWarren organizing house party, Barbara. Let me know how it goes!"
"Maddie is at our #WinWithWarren house party in Lebanon, New Hampshire this afternoon—one of the hundreds of parties we’re launching today to grow this grassroots movement. Thank you, Maddie!"
"Nora’s #WinWithWarren party is one of hundreds that we’re launching this weekend. Thank you so much for hosting, Nora! And you’re right: We need everybody in this fight."
"Think of all the people out there today who are paying their taxes: Families, small businesses, students. They can't take advantage of the loopholes in our tax code the way that giant corporations like Amazon can. That’s where my Real Corporate Profits Tax comes in."
"Woo-hoo! We’re launching hundreds of #WinWithWarren organizing house parties this weekend. These are great opportunities to come together in your community, get organized, and keep building our network. RSVP to a party in your community:"
The President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman—and an entire group of Americans based on their religion. It's disgusting. It's shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it.
"So happy to have you on our team, Lorenza!"
I’m with @SacTeachers all the way in their fight for living wages and better class sizes for our kids. #SCTA4Students
"No huge corporation in this country should get away with paying $0 in federal income tax, while small companies and families pick up the tab for running the country."
That looks DELICIOUS.

"The Trump administration’s treatment of Americans with disabilities is shameful and wrong. Social Security is a lifeline for millions of people with disabilities. We need to expand it, not make cuts."
We need to rein in the political and economic power of the giant tech companies. That’s why we’re fighting to #BreakUpBigTech.
This is just plain wrong. It’s unconstitutional. We’ll fight it. And we’ll win.
Giant companies have hired hordes of lobbyists to get the tax code written to create a special exception over here or a special loophole over there. They wouldn’t be able to get away with that under my Real Corporate Profits Tax.
LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. I’m glad to see Arizona make this their law.
"While @StopandShop's parent company made $2 billion in profits and got a tax cut from the #GOPTaxScam, @UFCW workers were getting squeezed by low wages and lousy benefits. We’re not gonna put up with it. #UnionStrong."
I will always stand side by side with our workers and our unions.
"I stand with the @UFCW and @StopandShop workers on the picket line. This strike is about 31K workers across New England making their voices heard and fighting for living wages and better benefits. When workers fight, workers win."
"You can raise the corporate tax rate, but with loopholes companies could still pay $0. That’s where my Real Corporate Profits Tax comes in. Thanks for having me yesterday, @SRuhle."
"Let me be very clear: If someone can handle the job, they should be allowed to serve—regardless of how they identify or who they love. We’ll stand with service members and fight this cruelty with everything we’ve got."
"Thank you, Lisa, for hosting a #WinWithWarren organizing house party this weekend! These house parties are how we’ll continue building a national network of grassroots supporters. So gather your friends and neighbors, and sign up to participate:"
.@StopandShop workers deserve fair wages and good benefits—and I’m behind them 100% of the way. I stand in solidarity with @UFCW and the 31K workers who are making their voices heard.
Happy #NationalPetDay! Missed my guy while I was in Washington.
"Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, it would be illegal for David Bernhardt to serve as Secretary of the Interior. A former oil lobbyist has no business leading a department charged with protecting our environment."
"National Weekend of Action is right around the corner—and we’re launching hundreds of #WinWithWarren organizing house parties across the country. Ashley stepped up to be a host, so I called her to say thanks. Find a party to attend this weekend:"
"This campaign isn’t like the others. I don’t get my money from PACs, corporate lobbyists, or fancy fundraisers. This movement is 100% powered by the people: Small-dollar donors who chip in $10 here, $5 there. Will you join our fight?"
"Tune in to @allinwithchris at 8 PM tonight as I talk about my new idea to make sure no company with billions in profits pays $0 in federal taxes. See you soon, @chrislhayes!"
"Last year, Amazon made more than $10 billion in profits and paid $0 in federal corporate income taxes. Yup—it’s outrageous. Here’s how my new Real Corporate Profits Tax idea works."
"What are #WinWithWarren house parties? These are get-togethers hosted by grassroots supporters in your community, where you can learn how to get more involved in our movement. Troy is hosting one this Saturday—so I called him to say thank you! RSVP:"

"In response to my plan, Amazon says it ""pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the US."" Yeah, I know. You made more than $10 billion in profits last year and you were required to pay $0 in federal corporate taxes. That's the problem."
"For decades, our government’s racist redlining laws blocked Black families from home ownership and building wealth. My new housing idea would level the playing field so everyone can have access to safe and affordable housing."
"This is a campaign about ideas and big, structural change. This is what we’re fighting for—and we’re just getting started."
"Our corporate income tax rules are riddled with loopholes, exemptions, and deductions. Even companies that tell shareholders they have made more than a billion dollars in profits can end up paying no corporate income taxes. I want to tackle that problem head on."
"To ensure every corporation pays their fair share,  we need a new kind of tax that big companies can’t get around. That’s what my new tax idea would accomplish."
You bet I do.
"I guess Rep. Brady is fine with 60 of the biggest corporations in the US paying $0 in taxes on a combined $79 billion in profits—while the rest of us pay federal taxes to fund our military, our roads, and our bridges.

I'm not, and my Real Corporate Profits Tax would fix that."
"My new idea, the Real Corporate Profits Tax, would fix some huge holes in our corporate tax code. Giant companies like Amazon shouldn’t be able to get away with paying $0 in federal corporate income taxes. Add your name if you agree."
So today I’m proposing a new idea: Tax the *real profits* very large American companies report to their investors—no loopholes or exemptions—and let’s make this year the last year any company with massive profits pays zero federal taxes.
"Big corporations have lobbied relentlessly to fill our corporate tax rules with so many loopholes and exemptions that even when they report a billion dollars in profits to their investors and the public, they can report much lower “profits” to the IRS—and pay no taxes on them."
"If you've already filed your taxes this year, chances are you paid more than a lot of the big corporations. They made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits this year—but many of them won’t pay a dime towards keeping our country safe and our economy strong."
"Wishing a happy #NationalSiblingsDay to my three big brothers: Don Reed, David, and John. All three of them answered our country’s call to serve. I’m eternally grateful for their service and the service of all our men and women in uniform."
"On Saturday April 13th during National Weekend of Action, hundreds of grassroots supporters are stepping up to host #WinWithWarren house parties in their homes—and we need you to participate! Find a party near you to attend or sign up to be a host:"
"On National Youth #HIV and #AIDS Awareness Day, I’m thinking about the over 60K youth living with HIV in the US, majorities of whom are LGBTQ+ Americans and people of color. We need to keep investing in research and treatment to end the AIDS epidemic."
"The Trump administration is pushing the construction of the Keystone XL route over public opposition—putting our communities, our environment, and tribal lands at risk. Let me be clear: We need clean energy and protection for tribes, not another dirty investment in fuel."
We need to rebuild unions in this country. That's why I’ve proposed a new law banning states from passing so-called right to work laws that destroy labor unions. It will make sure that unions have a front-and-center seat at the table in any trade negotiation.
Unions have always been the backbone of our country—and I’ll always fight for them.
"In life, there are some people who have more money. There are some people who have less money. But everybody should have an equal share of our democracy—no matter how much you donate. Let’s keep fighting hard, and if you’re able, make a donation today:"
"I’m really grateful for everyone who stepped up and chipped in before our first FEC deadline. Grassroots donations are the reason we can keep setting the tone for this race and fighting for big, structural change."
I told @NABTU: Unions built the middle class and unions will rebuild the middle class.

"In life, there are some people who have more money. There are some people who have less money. But everybody should have an equal share of our democracy—no matter how much you donate. Let’s keep fighting hard, and if you’re able, make a donation today:"
"I’m really grateful for everyone who stepped up and chipped in before our first FEC deadline. Grassroots donations are the reason we can keep setting the tone for this race and fighting for big, structural change."
I told @NABTU: Unions built the middle class and unions will rebuild the middle class.
We need to do everything we can to make sure Black mothers and babies are safe and sound. I’m glad to see Rep. @LaurenUnderwood and Rep. Alma Adams form this caucus in the House.
I’m glad my housing idea has support from Boston Mayor @marty_walsh and @Mayor_Spicer of Framingham. We’re dreaming big and fighting hard for 3.2 million new homes and more than a million new jobs in MA and across the country.
"Government should work for the people. That's why I've introduced a sweeping anti-corruption bill—requiring the IRS to release tax returns for presidential, vice-presidential, and congressional candidates."
"Today, I'm releasing my 2018 tax returns, and last August I released ten years worth of tax returns—because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for. Doing this should be law."
"There’s a crisis of faith in government—and that’s because the American people think the government works for the wealthy and well-connected, not for them. And they’re right."
"We need to lower drug costs and protect the Affordable Care Act. Everyone in this country deserves health care at the lowest possible cost, with the highest possible outcomes. That’s why I’m fighting for #Medicare4All."
"For most presidential candidates, “call time” means getting on the phone with ultra-wealthy donors who write out fat checks. Not me. This campaign is about the people. That’s why I’m spending “call time” thanking small-dollar donors. Maybe you’ll be next."
"Two months ago today, we kicked off this campaign, and I'm fired up by the movement that we've built together. Change like this is gonna be hard. But when we work together, organize together, and persist together, we'll make big structural change. We’re gonna do this!"
"Conversion therapy is dangerous and cruel, and I'm proud to see that Massachusetts has banned it for children. I will keep fighting to ban it at the federal level."
I’ve been following the @PittTweet students’ fight to unionize. Your voices are important and I want to see you win this one.
We need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen—no exceptions.
"See you soon, South Carolina!"
Attorney General Barr: The American people still need to see the full report.
"Wow, what a surprise. Two corrupt millionaires hanging out together."
"In Reno and across the country, people are fired up about issues like health care, the environment, and affordable housing—and I have some ideas about how we can address these problems head on."
Our criminal justice system is broken—and the violence in Alabama prisons is just the latest example of why we need to change it.
"David Bernhardt continued lobbying after formally declaring he was no longer a lobbyist. It’s outrageous. The Trump admin is a cesspool of corruption—and under my #EndCorruptionNow bill, it would be illegal for this guy to run the Department of @Interior."
"I talked to families who had been separated at the border—mamas, babies, little boys and girls traumatized by the Trump administration’s inhumane policy. Make no mistake: If they try to reinstate his cruelty, we’ll fight this with everything we’ve got."
Our veterans deserve better than a @DeptVetAffairs that’s riddled with corruption. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would close the revolving door between the VA and special interests—and ban people like Jeff Miller from lobbying our government.
"Let me be as clear as I can: When Democrats next have power, we should be bold. It’s time to get rid of the filibuster if Senate Republicans abuse it to block the progress and change we need."

My team put together this great update from the road. And let me tell you: It was an action-packed weekend in Nevada and New York.
"It was great meeting your daughter, @Jakobsmama! She also promised to remember that running for president is what girls do."
"I’m glad it arrived, @MsLisaHendricks! I’m in the fight with you every day to stop gun violence and protect our kids."
"Thank you for having me, @AlexGoff84!"
"So happy to read this letter from Camille, who asked me a question at our organizing event in Glendale in February! Camille, I’m honored to hear that you think I’m someone to look up to. Just remember: When women fight, women win."
I love it! And what does he think about my idea for #UniversalChildCare?
"Workers have a right to fight for higher wages, health care, and pensions, and I’m with @CWAUnion and @AFSCME all the way."
About time. @SecNielsen’s legacy of tearing innocent families apart will follow her for the rest of her life—and she should be ashamed of the role she played. She was completely unqualified to lead @DHS—and that's why I voted against confirming her.
Captain Marvel with the grandkids!
"Thank you for sharing your story, @DonnaFEdwards. #UniversalChildCare would have helped families like yours and mine."
"I’m glad we got to meet, @AlysonGilles. Our kids deserve better, and I’ll never stop standing up to the NRA or fighting for #GunReformNow."
"I spent the day in Reno talking with Nevadans who want to see big, structural change in our country—like #MedicareForAll, 3.2 million new housing units, and a #GreenNewDeal."
"Black and brown women work more, get paid less, face decades of systemic discrimination, and are the least likely to be able to afford decent child care. That’s why I’m proposing a big, structural change: #UniversalChildCare and early education for all our kids."
"I have a new idea to tackle our housing crisis and provide relief to families in Nevada and across the country. We need big, structural changes in our country—like building 3.2 million new housing units—and I’m fighting for them."
"Early morning walk before our organizing event in Reno, Nevada."
Ended an action-packed day with a pop-up event at Sweet Science in Brooklyn to thank grassroots donors for chipping in whatever they could to this fight. We’re building something big—one person at a time.
"Everyone deserves access to affordable, quality child care. No exceptions."
We don’t get what we don’t fight for. We’re done with two sets of rules—one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats.
"In 2021, we WILL make the change that our country needs.

"Congress voted to end US support of the war in Yemen. Now Donald Trump should sign this bill into law. Civilians are suffering, and #YemenCantWait."
"In 2018, the Senate passed a bill to make lynching a federal crime. A similar bill was first introduced in 1918. It was killed repeatedly—by Senate filibusters. An entire century of obstruction because a small group of racists stopped the entire nation from doing what was right."
"We don’t get what we don’t fight for. It was an honor to be at the #NANconv2019 with @TheRevAl to talk about my new idea: In 2021, if Mitch McConnell puts petty partisanship ahead of our country, then we should get rid of the filibuster."
Every family in this country should have access to #UniversalChildCare—period.
Voter suppression is real. We have to call it out and fight back—starting with a constitutional amendment that establishes a nationally-recognized right to vote and a right to get that vote counted. #NANCONV2019
"For generations, the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice. If the Republicans put small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country, then we should get rid of the filibuster."
"With so much on the line for our country, there’s no place I’d rather be than standing shoulder to shoulder with grassroots fighters and the @NationalAction Network. Read my remarks from the #NANCONV19 here."
"It was an honor to be at #NANCONV19 today. For decades under the leadership of my friend @TheRevAL, the @NationalAction Network and the people in this room have been on the front lines of the fight for social, racial, and economic justice."
"In just a few minutes, I’ll be speaking at the @NationalAction Network Convention about the big, structural change we’re fighting for, and the powerful forces—including the Senate filibuster—that will try to hold progress back. Tune in here."
"We’re done with having two sets of rules. When Democrats have the White House again, if Mitch McConnell continues to put small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing our country, then we should get rid of the filibuster."
"I’ve watched Republicans abuse the rules when they’re out of power, then turn around and blow off the rules when they’re in power. We just saw it happen again this week when they unilaterally changed the same rules they abused to ram through President Trump's extreme nominees."
"For generations the filibuster has been used to block progress, and in recent years, obstruction in the Senate has only gotten worse. We’re fighting for big, structural change—but we won't get anything done unless we face this head on."
Jail time. That’s what you should get if you negligently oversee a big corporation that defrauds hard working Americans. My ideas tackle corporate fraud head on.
"Amazon used to promote its products above other vendors. Not anymore—they’re scared by my plan to #BreakUpBigTech. Now we need to make sure there are rules in place so it doesn’t happen again. You can be the umpire or you can own a team, but you can’t do both at the same time."
"Happy birthday, NATO! America is strongest when we work together with our allies. #NATO70"
"51 years ago the life of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was tragically taken away. They may kill the dreamer, but they can never kill the dream. Today and every day, we are the heirs of Dr. King’s dream & we are called to continue fighting for social, racial, & economic justice."
"Under my new proposal, corporate executives who negligently oversee a giant company causing severe harm to American families would face jail time. Sign our petition to become an official citizen co-sponsor."
"Great point, Jamie! How about we start with you giving back the $3.7 billion J.P. Morgan made this year off the #GOPTaxScam that you lobbied for?"
"At least 25 people in the Trump administration were denied security clearances, yet they insisted on ramming them through approval anyway. The man in the White House is putting our national security at risk."
I’m glad to hear that @JoyceCraigNH is running for re-election as mayor of Manchester. I know she’ll continue to fight for New Hampshire families. Go Joyce!

This grassroots movement starts with the people. I hope you’ll attend or host a #WinWithWarren house party in your community on April 13th. Are you in?
"What a historic night for Chicago! Congratulations, Lori Lightfoot."
"After the big banks crashed our economy 10 years ago, guess how many CEOs went to prison for their frauds? Zero. My new idea would hold executives at big companies criminally accountable—if you negligently oversee scams on the American people, you should go to jail."
People should be able to live without fear or discrimination—regardless of who they love.
I’m proud down to my toes that our team is growing across the country—and we’re not even done yet! You can check out our open positions here:
You know the system is rigged when the IRS targets working Americans while dedicating fewer and fewer resources to holding the ultra-wealthy taxpayers accountable.
No wealthy donors. No fancy closed door fundraisers. Just people who pitch in what they can to keep growing this grassroots movement.
"Today, I’m proposing a new law that expands criminal liability to any corporate executive who negligently oversees a company that causes severe and widespread harm to families. Our justice system should ensure that if you cheat working Americans, you’ll go to jail."
"But we need to go further. From Equifax to BP, top executives across the country have overseen corporate conduct that has done real harm to American families—and walked away without any jail time."
Congress should start by enacting the Ending Too Big To Jail Act I introduced last year. This bill would make it easier to hold executives at big banks criminally liable for scams.
"It’s been 10 years since the financial crash cost millions of people their homes, jobs, and savings. But not one big bank CEO has gone to jail. It’s time to reform our laws to make sure that corporate executives face jail time for overseeing massive scams."
I’m grateful that people around the country have joined forces to host #WinWithWarren parties on April 13th and beyond. We’re going to do this together! Are you signed up to attend or host in your community?
Organizers are an essential part of this campaign. I’m glad that Juliana is leading our movement in Iowa.
"If we want to tackle the opioid epidemic head on, then we have to hold Big Pharma executives accountable. Rep. Elijah Cummings and I have a plan that demands accountability and provides communities with the resources they need to beat this."
This is a disgrace. Our service-members deserve to be treated with respect.
The man in the White House is obsessed with holding up the funds to help Puerto Rico recover more than a year after Hurricane Maria. Three million US citizens live on the island and we need to show them some respect.
"For decades, government policy has worked to keep us separate from each other while neglecting nearly every kind of housing—suburban, rural, and urban. My housing policy rejects this legacy of segregation and disdain to build better communities for everyone."
"I’m keeping Ashanti and her loved ones in my prayers. At least 26 trans people were killed in 2018, and most of them were women of color. We need to call that out—and fight back."

One way we can fight for #EqualPay is to guarantee affordable child care and early education for every kid in America. And I've got a plan to do just that.   #EqualPayDay
"Too many families don't have an Aunt Bee, or access to quality child care. And too often, it's women whose careers and paychecks take the hit when they don't have child care."
"I was teaching at a law school in Houston when the kids were little and, suddenly, the babysitter quit. I tried all sorts of child care options, but none of them worked out. I thought I'd have to quit my job. But my Aunt Bee flew down to help out, and I kept my job."
"The Trump administration rammed through security clearances that had been turned down. The administration is a walking, talking, living, breathing threat to national security, and we just have to call it out."
We don’t win if we don’t fight. I’m in this fight all the way for big ideas like #UniversalChildCare and the #UltraMillionaireTax that will move our country forward.
Giant corporations have figured out a way to cut out the competition and take more profits for themselves—squeezing the life out of family farms. My new idea would tackle this head on.
Voter suppression is real—and we need to put more federal muscle in the fight to end it. That's why we need a constitutional amendment that protects every American citizen's right to vote and to have that vote counted.
Looking forward to speaking at the #WeThePeople19 Summit this afternoon. Tune in at 3:30 PM ET!
"No tricks, only treats. #AprilFoolsDay"
"Housing is already the biggest expense for most families—and it's just getting worse. Every American deserves a safe, decent, and affordable place to live, and my housing plan will reduce rents by 10%."
We've got to fight back against consolidation. It's time to reverse the Bayer-Monsanto merger.
"I love getting pictures with everyone who comes out to our organizing events. No matter how long it takes, I’ll be there taking selfies till the end"
"Chicago: I hope you’ll cast your vote for my friend, Michael @NegronFor47, tomorrow! He's a real fighter who works every day to level the playing field for America’s working families. He’ll be a terrific Alderman for the 47th ward. Polls are open from 6 AM to 7 PM."
"In just a few hours, we’ll close the books on our first big FEC fundraising deadline. This is a chance to show the strength of our grassroots movement."
"Proud to have you on our team, Chris."
"Thank you, @HrishiHirway. I’m glad to have you in this fight."
"Today’s big tech companies have too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. I’m fighting for a government that makes sure everyone, even the biggest and most powerful companies in America, plays by the rules."
We’re building something big—one small-dollar donation at a time. Chip in $3 or more before tonight at midnight.
"It’s not a democracy when our government puts the interests of Big Pharma first. Trump’s NAFTA was designed to work well for wealthy corporations, not the people. We need to fix it."
This is how we make sure every vote counts! I’m glad to see that another state has pledged to give its Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote.

We've got to fight back against consolidation. It's time to reverse the Bayer-Monsanto merger.
"I love getting pictures with everyone who comes out to our organizing events. No matter how long it takes, I’ll be there taking selfies till the end"
"Chicago: I hope you’ll cast your vote for my friend, Michael @NegronFor47, tomorrow! He's a real fighter who works every day to level the playing field for America’s working families. He’ll be a terrific Alderman for the 47th ward. Polls are open from 6 AM to 7 PM."
"In just a few hours, we’ll close the books on our first big FEC fundraising deadline. This is a chance to show the strength of our grassroots movement."
"Proud to have you on our team, Chris."
"Thank you, @HrishiHirway. I’m glad to have you in this fight."
"Today’s big tech companies have too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. I’m fighting for a government that makes sure everyone, even the biggest and most powerful companies in America, plays by the rules."
We’re building something big—one small-dollar donation at a time. Chip in $3 or more before tonight at midnight.
"It’s not a democracy when our government puts the interests of Big Pharma first. Trump’s NAFTA was designed to work well for wealthy corporations, not the people. We need to fix it."
This is how we make sure every vote counts! I’m glad to see that another state has pledged to give its Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote.
On #TransDayOfVisibility I want every trans person to know: You are valued. You are equal. You are loved. We’re in this fight with you all the way. #TDOV
"I’m running for president, but I can’t do it alone. We’re up against our first big FEC deadline tonight at midnight. Will you join our fight and chip in?"
The @Boeing crisis isn’t just about a technical issue: It’s systemic corruption. There’s a revolving door between industry and regulators—where the people lose and big corporations win. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would close that door.
"Last year, farmers got less than 15 cents of every dollar that Americans spent on food—the lowest amount since the Department of Agriculture began tracking that figure in 1993. My plan to break up agribusinesses like Monsanto would help family farmers get what they deserve."
"I want Washington to work for family farmers, not just for the agribusiness executives pocketing multi-million dollar bonuses. I joined Family Farm Action today to say loud and clear: We need a Farmers Bill of Rights."
"At the Heartland Forum, I talked about how Washington should work for family farmers across America—not just the agribusiness executives pocketing multi-million dollar bonuses or the Wall Street traders."
"Those cookies have been a #TeamWarren favorite for years—mine, too. Thank you for everything you do, Barbara!"
"Today I’ll be speaking at the Heartland Forum about my ideas to make big, structural change in America’s rural communities. Tune in at 2 PM ET:"
"I don’t just talk the talk, I walk the walk. Instead of spending time at fancy fundraisers, I’m spending my time on the phone with grassroots donors who chip in online. Chip in before our big FEC deadline (you might just get a call from me to thank you!)"
"It was great meeting you, @beccagrawl! What can I say: Bruce is a great photographer."
".@Uber and @lyft executives are preparing to cash in by taking their companies public, so they're squeezing their drivers and slashing their pay. The drivers are fighting for living wages and better working conditions—and I stand with them."
"When I thought about jumping into the Senate race in 2012, I heard this over and over again: “Don’t run. A woman can’t win here. Not yet.”

We proved the naysayers wrong. We won by 7.5 points."
"Today in Perry, Iowa I wanted to be perfectly clear: When I'm president of the United States, no veteran will ever be deported."
"We need your help before our first big FEC deadline. Like @janicero says, even a couple bucks goes a long way!"
"This is a campaign of ideas—like #UniversalChildCare, the #UltraMillionaireTax, and a plan to #BreakUpBigTech. Will you chip in now to help hit our goal before Sunday’s first big FEC deadline?"
Just wrapped up our event in Marshalltown where I answered my 200th town hall question (it was about climate change). I’ll keep fighting to protect the planet for our children and grandchildren.
I told @HardballChris: The Mueller report needs to be made public. That’s all there is to it.
The Koch brothers act tough. But they're terrified of anything that challenges the political power of giant companies & billionaires. That's why they're spending freely against my idea to #BreakUpBigTech. But Americans are tired of getting run over—and we're ready to fight back.
We're the richest nation in the history of the world. But the wealthy and the well-connected rig the system to benefit themselves. An #UltraMillionaireTax on the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans would level the playing field for everyone.
Santee Cooper is showering its executives with big bonuses—while ratepayers foot the bill. I’m glad the South Carolina legislature is tackling this corporate greed head on.

"In Greenville, Mississippi and rural communities across America, home ownership has gotten further and further out of reach. My new proposal would give families everywhere a real shot at the American dream."
300 pages—and all we’ve seen is a 5th grade book report from the President's handpicked AG. Attorney General Barr: #ReleaseTheFullReport now.
Consolidation is choking family farms. But there’s a whole lot of other ways in which big business has rigged the rules in their favor and hard working farmers across the country have been left behind. I’ll fight to change those rules.
"Outrageous. Many Americans work full-time, minimum-wage jobs and still live paycheck to paycheck—while the average bonus for a Wall Street banker has gone up 1000% since 1989. It’s why I’m in this fight."
"Trump and the Republicans never wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They've always wanted to burn it down. We need #MedicareForAll and we need a government that works for the people, not for giant drug companies."
"By the way, getting fired shouldn't be the end of the story for Tim Sloan. He shouldn't get a golden parachute. He should be investigated by the SEC and the DOJ for his role in all the Wells Fargo scams. And if he's guilty of any crimes, he should be put in jail like anyone else."
BREAKING: We also had iced tea!
"About damn time. Tim Sloan should have been fired a long time ago. He enabled Wells Fargo's massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, & then helped cover it up. Now—let's make sure all the people hurt by Wells Fargo's scams get the relief they're owed."
"I’ll be in Storm Lake, Marshalltown, and West Des Moines this weekend. Will we see you there? RSVP here."
"Last night, I told @chrislhayes: In this Democratic primary, we need to push our big, bold ideas forward. We can do this together."
"Right now, farmers are caught in a vise—but it doesn’t have to be that way. We can make better policy choices , and we can begin by leveling the playing field for America’s family farmers."
"Thank you, Brandon! I’m glad we got to talk. We’re building something big—one small-dollar donation at a time."
"It was really me, @JMarquette2113! Thanks for being a part of our movement."
Betsy DeVos is the worst education secretary in living memory. We need opportunities for all of our kids—not just some of them.
Oh look—the Koch brothers don’t like my ideas. Apparently they're horrified about any effort to try and rein in the economic and political power of giant corporations. I'm shocked.
"Candidates for president don’t always go to MS, TN, or AL because they aren’t battleground states. But I’m running to be president of the entire United States. I’m planning to travel to every corner of this country—and I’ve got the best staff who will make it happen!"
"The solution is pretty clear, @NASA: Make another suit."
"I’m grateful to have @RogerLau leading our campaign. This is how we see this fight, and this is how we plan to win."
"See you in just a few minutes, @chrislhayes! Looking forward to talking about my ideas to make big, structural change. Tune into @allinwithchris at 8 PM ET."

"“It’s just too hard”—that’s what people told abolitionists, suffragettes, early labor organizers, civil rights leaders, and the first LGBTQ rights activists. Yet every one of them stayed in the fight, and persisted. It’s our moment to change the direction of American history."
"Giant agribusinesses like Monsanto have too much power to squeeze farmers. One of my new ideas to help farmers is to appoint trustbusters to review—and reverse—mergers, including the recent Bayer-Monsanto merger that should never have been approved."
"Thanks for picking up my call, @jocelyn_roof. I’m so glad we got to talk!"
Democrats have a chance to help end the influence of big money in politics in the 2020 primary. I’m walking the walk.
"The man in the White House and Senate Republicans are failing to extend important SNAP benefits in Puerto Rico, potentially hurting thousands of people across the island. Our government needs to show the people of Puerto Rico some respect."
Big Pharma executives need to be held accountable when they break the law. My sweeping plan with Rep. Elijah Cummings does just that—and tackles our country’s opioid epidemic head on.
"The people of Selma—and Americans across the country—deserve access to safe, affordable housing. That’s what my housing plan does."
I want Washington to work for family farmers—not just for the agribusiness executives pocketing multi-million dollar bonuses. That is how we build an economy that works for everyone.
"Today a farmer can work hard, do everything right — even get great weather — and still not make it. My new idea would level the playing field for America’s farmers by standing up to Big Ag and un-rigging the rules that are hurting competition."
"The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. Without it, millions of American families would lose health care coverage. I’ll fight tooth and nail to protect it."
The American people deserve to see it. #ReleaseTheFullReport
The Republicans and the man in the White House have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act at every turn. But the American people have come together time and time again to protect the ACA—and we’re not about to back down.
"I’m so glad to have @janicero leading @IAforWarren. River to river, county by county, Janice is dreaming big and fighting hard."
"If we have an #UltraMillionaireTax on the richest 0.1% of people in this country, we can use the money for ideas that will help millions of Americans—like a #GreenNewDeal and #UniversalChildCare. @StephenAtHome is on board!"
"When I first ran for Senate in 2012, we were up against a Republican opponent who was bankrolled by special interests and the RNC. Then we out-raised him—one small-dollar donor at a time. I need you in the 2020 fight. Will you pitch in what you can?"
"See you again soon, Iowa!"
"Amazon has too much power. You can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both in the same game. #BreakUpBigTech"
"I stand with the @Palms workers who are fighting for strong wages, comprehensive benefits, and dignity on the job. It's time for management to come to the negotiating table."
"Let’s call @Boeing’s ties to the US government what they are: Corruption, plain and simple. The American people should be able to trust that our government is working for us—not giant defense contractors."
"I stood on the Senate floor while we hung onto health care for millions of Americans by a single vote. We won't back down. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights."

"I agree. By getting rid of the electoral college and replacing it with a national popular vote, we can protect our democracy and make sure everyone’s vote counts."
Public financing of elections is the single best solution to reduce the undue influence of big money in our politics. And New York could be on the road to #FairElections this week! Hope this passes in the state budget.
Looking forward to talking with @StephenAtHome tonight. I hope you’ll tune in to @colbertlateshow!
"We have failed the people of Sandy Hook, Parkland, and the communities that face these tragedies every day. We mourn for Mr. Richman’s family again—but Congress must act. No family should have to suffer this pain and hopelessness."
"Monsanto has a moral obligation to tell the public what it knows about the health effects of its weedkiller, Roundup, before more people get sick."

"When WhatsApp started growing, Facebook had to make a choice: They could either do better on their privacy policy or buy out the competition. Guess what they did? #BreakUpBigTech"
"After my daddy’s heart attack, my family almost lost our house. My mother got a minimum wage job at Sears, and it saved our family. Today, a minimum wage job can’t even support a mama and a baby. Time to rebuild the middle class. Will you join us?"
"Thank you, Earle, for listening to my speech in 2015—and for being a part of our fight for big, structural change like my housing plan. Black lives matter and Black families matter."
"I’m humbled to have your support, Pastor Kathy. Let’s do this together!"
"Our government is failing Americans like Monica and Pete. No matter how hard they tried to play by the rules, they lost everything.

We need a government that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That’s why I’m running for president."
"Donald Trump is not the cause of what's broken, he's just the latest symptom of what's gone wrong in America. He is a product of a rigged system that props up the rich and the powerful—and kicks dirt on everyone else."

"A year ago today, people across the country organized and took a stand against gun violence at the @AMarch4OurLives. There’s a lot of pain in this country caused by gun violence—and we’re fighting our hearts out to end it. I’ll go where the Parkland students lead."
Bruce and I are heartsick for the victim and his loved ones. I’m keeping the Parkland community in my prayers throughout this difficult week. We need to end the cycle of pain caused by gun violence. We need gun reform—now.
"Congress voted 420-0 to release the full Mueller report. Not a ""summary"" from his handpicked Attorney General. AG Barr, make the full report public. Immediately."
"My housing idea would build 3.2 million new units across the country—including here in Conway. Thank you for the wonderful conversation about housing, supporting our unions, and the environment this afternoon. Glad my guys came too!"
Fun fact: Bruce and I love maple syrup! We were glad to visit the Believe in Books Sugar Shack in Intervale to hear about their efforts to increase childhood literacy and learn how maple syrup is made.

"We need to make sure that Robert Mueller’s report is released to the American public. Remember: This investigation has already resulted in dozens of indictments, convictions, and guilty pleas. Sign our petition to make the Mueller report public."
"Girls dream big, fight hard, and run for president."
"Republicans are working hard to roll back a woman’s right to control our own bodies. But let’s be clear: We won’t go back—not now, not ever. We’ll fight this with everything we’ve got."
"Nine years ago today, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. I won’t stop fighting to make health care accessible and affordable for everyone. #MedicareForAll"
"This morning I was glad to visit Friendship House, an addiction treatment center in Bethlehem. Many of its patients have recovered from opioid addiction. My opioid plan with Rep. Elijah Cummings would invest in centers like Friendship House so we can tackle this epidemic head on."
"I’m heartsick for Sydney Aiello, her loved ones, and the Parkland community. We need real, structural gun reform in this country to end the cycle of pain caused by gun violence."
Heading to New Hampshire!
"For a lot of candidates, “call time” means spending hours on the phone every day with ultra-wealthy donors who write fat checks. This is my version of call time."
Robert Mueller’s finished his report. He’s delivered it to Attorney General William Barr. The American people deserve the full report. Sign our petition to make the Mueller report public—immediately.
Attorney General Barr—release the Mueller report to the American public. Now.
"Mr. President: Chairman Kim is not your buddy, and the North Korean nuclear program is a national security threat to the United States. Reversing North Korea's sanctions hours after they were announced is chaos. Foreign policy by tweet does not make Americans safer."
"This week I was in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama. I had powerful conversations with people about how we can make big, structural change in this country. Here’s an update from the road."
"Last night on @TheLastWord, I talked with @AliVelshi about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech. Giant tech companies like Google and Facebook have too much power—and we need to act."
Happy #NationalPuppyDay to my go-to guy.
"What can we do to make a real difference in Cleveland, MS where families can’t afford the skyrocketing costs of living expenses? We put more money into housing so everyone can have a safe and affordable place to live."
"I’m so glad to be back in New Hampshire this weekend! Will we see you there? Littleton, Berlin, and Conway—see you soon."
“Conversion therapy” is cruel. I’m glad to see the government of Puerto Rico taking real steps to end this immoral practice. People should be able to love who they love without fear or discrimination.
"With fewer competitors in the market, big tech companies like Facebook don’t have to compete in key areas like protecting our privacy. That would change under my plan to #BreakUpBigTech."
"Health care is a human right. And Medicaid is a commitment that says if your family gets sick, the rest of us will be there. I’m glad to see that Kansas is on its way to expanding this program."
"We packed into city hall yesterday and talked about the big, structural changes we’re fighting for—like a Green New Deal and getting rid of the electoral college. Thank you, Berlin!"
"We need to make sure that Robert Mueller’s report is released to the American public. Remember: This investigation has already resulted in dozens of indictments, convictions, and guilty pleas. Sign our petition to make the Mueller report public."
"Girls dream big, fight hard, and run for president."
"Republicans are working hard to roll back a woman’s right to control our own bodies. But let’s be clear: We won’t go back—not now, not ever. We’ll fight this with everything we’ve got."
"Nine years ago today, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. I won’t stop fighting to make health care accessible and affordable for everyone. #MedicareForAll"
"This morning I was glad to visit Friendship House, an addiction treatment center in Bethlehem. Many of its patients have recovered from opioid addiction. My opioid plan with Rep. Elijah Cummings would invest in centers like Friendship House so we can tackle this epidemic head on."
"I’m heartsick for Sydney Aiello, her loved ones, and the Parkland community. We need real, structural gun reform in this country to end the cycle of pain caused by gun violence."
Heading to New Hampshire!
"For a lot of candidates, “call time” means spending hours on the phone every day with ultra-wealthy donors who write fat checks. This is my version of call time."
Robert Mueller’s finished his report. He’s delivered it to Attorney General William Barr. The American people deserve the full report. Sign our petition to make the Mueller report public—immediately.
Attorney General Barr—release the Mueller report to the American public. Now.
"Mr. President: Chairman Kim is not your buddy, and the North Korean nuclear program is a national security threat to the United States. Reversing North Korea's sanctions hours after they were announced is chaos. Foreign policy by tweet does not make Americans safer."
"This week I was in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama. I had powerful conversations with people about how we can make big, structural change in this country. Here’s an update from the road."
"Last night on @TheLastWord, I talked with @AliVelshi about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech. Giant tech companies like Google and Facebook have too much power—and we need to act."
Happy #NationalPuppyDay to my go-to guy.
"What can we do to make a real difference in Cleveland, MS where families can’t afford the skyrocketing costs of living expenses? We put more money into housing so everyone can have a safe and affordable place to live."

Bigotry and hate have no place in the United States of America. Period.
Every voter matters. That includes voters in Mississippi. And whoever gets the most votes should win. I was honored to travel to @JacksonStateU and talk with a fired-up crowd about issues that matter—including getting rid of the electoral college.
"All three of my brothers joined the military—Don Reed and John went into the Air Force, and David joined the Army. My mother would wait every day for a letter while they were deployed. I know how important it is to support our service members and our military families."
"I don’t take PAC money or checks from federal lobbyists. This grassroots movement is by the people, for the people—and it’s going to take all of us fighting side by side to win in #2020. Let’s do this together."
I’m with @davidcicilline. Facebook has too much power—and we need answers.
"We’re not going to solve our housing crisis by nibbling at the edges. We need to tackle it head on—with big, comprehensive solutions that match the size of the problems we have. That’s what my housing plan does."
Even Big Oil says we need stronger rules to limit methane and combat climate change. We have to tackle this problem head on—that’s why my climate bill would require these companies to publish their greenhouse gas emissions.
The American people should be able to trust that government officials are working for them—not big defense contractors like @Boeing. My #EndCorruptionNow bill would have banned Shanahan from serving as acting Defense Secretary in the first place.
"What would it be like to have a school teacher in the White House? As a former special needs teacher, I think it would be fabulous. I won’t stop fighting for America’s public school teachers and our students."
There are up to four million people in Florida who can vote but aren’t registered. I’m so glad to see @AndrewGillum’s new initiative to help Floridians register to vote.
Unions are the backbone of our country. I stand with the Amazon workers who are organizing and fighting for better working conditions. #1u
"Woo-hoo—congratulations, senator-elect @EricGiddens4IA!"
"I went to Brown’s Chapel and the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama with Rep. Terri Sewell yesterday—places with powerful legacies of people coming together and fighting for civil rights and a better country. It gave me hope."
"Let’s dream big, fight hard—and win! Thank you to everyone who came out to our grassroots organizing event in Birmingham."
This is exactly why we need to #BreakUpBigTech. Companies like Google have too much power—and fines alone won’t fix the problem.
"This week in Mississippi, we had a powerful conversation with Greenville and Cleveland community leaders about the housing crisis in our country. Thanks to Mayor Simmons and Mable Starks for showing me around the Greater Greenville Housing Revitalization Association."
Millions of Americans like Amber are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I say it’s time to address this problem head on.
We need to have policies on immigration that are consistent with our values—and we need answers from @CBP.
"In today’s economy, a person working a minimum-wage job can't afford decent housing—and that's just immoral. It's time we tackle the housing crisis head on."
"Access to quality, affordable housing unlocks opportunities for families across the country. I’m working hard to level the playing field for working parents like LaTonya."

"16 years ago today, the US invaded Iraq. The costs of that mistake are staggering: 4,751 brave Americans killed, tens of thousands more wounded, untold civilian casualties. We owe it to our service members to do better. Time to bring our troops home and end these endless wars."
I’m glad the people of Iowa are starting to return to their homes. Always grateful for the first responders who helped families stay safe during the flood.

"Every vote should count equally, no matter where you live. It’s time to get rid of the Electoral College and elect our presidents with a national popular vote. Read more."
"I’m not doing things the way traditional candidates for the presidency would do. I’m not holding fundraisers for wealthy donors. I’m spending my time with people all across the country who believe that our grassroots movement can make big, structural change. Thank you, Memphis!"
Everyone deserves a safe and affordable place to live—in Mississippi and across the country.
I believe we are called on to act.
Our differences make us stronger. I will fight against all forms of bigotry and hate—including white nationalism.
"Thank you, @AmirTalai! We’re in this fight together."
The way we make sure that every vote is counted is by getting rid of the Electoral College and making the national popular vote a central part of our democracy.
Every vote should count—and the way we can make that happen is getting rid of the Electoral College.

The man in the White House let @GM executives give billions of dollars in stock buybacks to their rich stakeholders while workers were left out in the cold. That’s why I’m fighting to level the playing field for working families across the country.

"Make sure you get out to vote, Black Hawk County!"
Homeownership is out of reach for too many families—especially Black families. Decades of discrimination by the federal government denied families of color the same kinds of homeownership subsidies available to white families. We need to tackle this head on.
"Add your name as a citizen co-sponsor of my American Housing and Economic Mobility Act. Let’s work together to ensure every American has a safe, decent, and affordable place to live."
"Let's be clear: We’re not going to solve our housing crisis by nibbling at the edges. We need to tackle it head on—with big, comprehensive solutions that match the size of the problems we have. That’s what my housing plan for America does."
Government regulators looked the other way before the 2008 crisis as predatory financial institutions targeted minority communities and sucked billions of dollars in wealth out of them.
The gap between white homeownership rates and Black homeownership rates is 30%—more than it was when housing discrimination was legal in 1960.
Government at all levels hasn’t done enough to tackle our housing problems. The federal government has reduced investments in housing for middle-class and lower-income families even as rents have gone up.
I still think about these gut-wrenching stories because it’s a powerful reminder of what housing means in our country. That's why it's so important for government to get housing policy right.
"During the 2008 housing crisis, I traveled to NV to hear the stories of those who'd lost their homes. I was part of the panel that oversaw how the Treasury Department was spending the bank bailout money, and I wanted to make sure we heard from the people being hit the hardest."
Housing is one of the biggest purchases most Americans will make in their lifetimes. My new Housing plan would address some of the most pressing issues that have kept homeownership out of reach for too many families. Here’s how we’re going to do it:

I’m proud of how the Sandy Hook community organized and stood up to the gun lobbyists to secure this victory. We won’t stop fighting for #GunReformNow.
A fake crisis at the border is fear-mongering of the worst kind—and we’re not falling for it. I voted to terminate the president’s ridiculous “national emergency.”

"Today on @Morning_Joe, I talked with @WillieGeist and @morningmika about my new plan to #BreakUpBigTech. They asked me if I thought Google, Amazon, and Facebook are all monopolies. Here’s my answer."
"About time. Now it's Congress's job to figure out what went wrong here, and why this decision took so long, to make sure it doesn't happen again. Nothing should come before the safety and security of the American people—especially not corporate profits or political favors."
Paul Manafort just got 43 more months for a new raft of crimes. Black men like Bernard Noble can get decades just for selling 2 joints. We need criminal justice reform so the well-connected play by the same rules as everyone else. Now.
Glad to see Boston will be hosting the @NAACP’s 111th national convention!
"See you soon, @JacksonStateU! You too, @jaketapper."
First Donald Trump stacked the @EPA with corrupt climate change deniers—now he wants to slash the agency's budget by 31%. It's a disgrace. The effects of climate change are real and we have a moral obligation to protect the future for our kids.
"Planned Parenthood provides health care for millions of women in Ohio and across the country. This decision is an attack on women’s reproductive rights. We won’t go back—not now, not ever."
"A president who actually cares about the American people's safety does not decide whether to ground an airplane based on Boeing's profits, Boeing's political donations, the rich CEO's visit to Mar-a-Lago, or personal phone calls. The FAA needs to get this plane out of the sky."
"The Trump administration wants to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the #Medicare budget, all while giving billionaires and giant corporations huge tax breaks with the #GOPTaxScam. This is immoral."
"The Boeing 737 MAX 8 is a major driver of profits. In the coming weeks and months, Congress must hold hearings on whether an administration that famously refused to stand up to Saudi Arabia to protect @Boeing arms sales has once again put lives at risk for the same reason."
"The FAA itself has indicated that software updates are likely coming. Any necessary changes must be made before, not after, more flights occur and more lives are potentially endangered."
"Charleston, Pittsburgh, and now Christchurch. Everyone should have the right to worship without fear, and an attack on a place of worship is terrorism perpetrated against all of us. My heart goes out to the people of New Zealand today."
I’m proud of how the Sandy Hook community organized and stood up to the gun lobbyists to secure this victory. We won’t stop fighting for #GunReformNow.
A fake crisis at the border is fear-mongering of the worst kind—and we’re not falling for it. I voted to terminate the president’s ridiculous “national emergency.”
"Yesterday on @Morning_Joe, I explained how we’re going to break up Big 
Tech companies like Amazon. You can read more about that here:"
Despicable.

We witnessed the second tragic crash of @Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes in less than 6 months. We don’t know the cause of these crashes—but serious questions have been raised about whether these planes were pressed into service without additional pilot training.

Woo-hoo! Looking forward to talking with @AnandWrites about our presidential primary campaign and my plan to #BreakUpBigTech. Watch the interview live through this link at 2:00 PM CST today:   #SXSW2019
"Wow—thank you, Long Island City! You showed everyone what’s possible when people fight back. We can #BreakUpBigTech to protect our democracy and our economy, and we must."
"Today was my first pop-up event with grassroots donors—people who’ve chipped in $25 here, or $5 there—in East Harlem. Glad we got a chance to talk about how we’re running a campaign by the people, for the people. Watch your emails and texts for one near you!"
Watch live as I discuss my new plan to #BreakUpBigTech.
"I’m looking forward to talking at @SXSW about my plans for big, structural change to make our country work for working people. Can’t wait to see you all there. #SXSW2019"
"I want every little girl to grow up knowing that they can fight from the heart — and they can win. Today, and every day, I want to celebrate every woman who wakes up ready to fight to make life better for them. #InternationalWomensDay #WomensHistoryMonth"
"Today’s big tech companies have too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy—and in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation. That’s why my administration would make big, structural changes to the tech industry."
"Glad to spend some quality time this morning with our grassroots movement. Thanks for having us, @HotBreadKitchen!"
"Good news: The House just passed the #ForThePeople Act, which includes key elements from my #EndCorruptionNow bill, to start cleaning up corruption in Washington.

I’m joining @StopBigMoney to demand that @senatemajldr give the bill a vote on the Senate floor. Are you with us?"
"Looking forward to talking more about my big new plan to #BreakUpBigTech. See you soon, @AriMelber!"
"Facebook, Amazon, and Google run the internet. In fact, Big Tech spent almost $50 million dollars in lobbying last year. They know they have a lot to lose if Washington starts putting the interests of consumers first. #BreakUpBigTech"
"We can get this done. We can make big, structural change. But it’s going to take a grassroots movement, and it starts right now. Sign our petition if you agree, and let's get ready to fight hard together."
This policy will ensure that tech entrepreneurs have a fighting chance to compete against the big companies. That’s how we get innovation.
Let's be clear: This policy won't limit your ability to go on Amazon and find 30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days. And you’ll still be able to go on Facebook and see how your old friend from school is doing.
What I’m proposing is in line with our country’s history of antitrust laws—and it’s a big part of what has allowed our economy to grow and new companies to thrive. You can read more about how our plan is going to work here:
"We’ve got to call it out. And we’ve got to do something about it. So today, I’m proposing a new plan to #BreakUpBigTech companies, restore competition, and make sure these corporations don’t get so powerful that they undermine our democracy."
America’s biggest tech companies are controlling more and more of our digital lives. And they’re using their size and power to make it harder for the next tech entrepreneur with the next big idea to break through and compete with them—meaning less options for us.
"Facebook, Amazon, and Google have vast power over our economy and democracy. They’ve bulldozed competition and tilted the playing field in their favor. Time to break up these companies so they don’t have so much power over everyone else. #BreakUpBigTech"
Wonder if Bailey can tell us apart. I'm flattered—and the grandkids can't wait to see Captain Marvel!

"We can’t afford to just tinker around the edges—a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big, structural change. Thank you, Waterloo!"
"Without child care, millions of American families would sink. I know because that's what almost sank me. This story is part of my heart – and it's a big reason why I'm fighting for #UniversalChildCare."
My grandkids make me feel like the luckiest Gammy in the world. I was tickled to have them with me in Los Angeles last weekend!
I love having my guy on the campaign trail with me.
"For generations, it was official government policy to redline neighborhoods to prevent African Americans from owning homes. Many communities never recovered. My housing bill is a step towards rectifying the wrongs of the past."
Dubuque is a terrific city. The people I met are determined and ready to get in this fight all the way. Let’s go!
"The biggest threat right now: Donald Trump, or the next president, using the pardon power to cover up & permanently excuse wrongdoings. Add your name if you agree: No pardons or commutations for anyone implicated in investigations related to Donald Trump."
"Dubuque, Elkader, Decorah, Waterloo: I’m so glad to be here in Iowa today and Saturday! Join me at an event this weekend:"
"When I meet a little girl on the campaign trail, I take her pinky and say: “I’m running for president, because that’s what girls do.” This #WomensHistoryMonth, I’m celebrating every woman who wakes up ready to fight to make life better for all the girls who’ll come after us."
"The @CYDiowa young Democrats that I met were smart, determined, and they had the type of energy that’s going to change the world. I’m glad to be heading back to Iowa today!"
"Here’s the deal: Health care is a right for all, not a privilege for a few. We need #MedicareForAll, and we need it now."
I’m jazzed up to be in Iowa again this weekend. See you soon!
"In 28 states across the country, child care costs more than tuition at the state university. I told the crowd in Los Angeles: That isn’t right, and we can do something about it."
"Corruption—in Israel, in the US, or anywhere else—is a cancer that threatens democracy. We need to fight back. And we can start by having the courage to call it out wherever it occurs. Even among our allies. Especially here at home."
"First embracing right-wing extremism. Now manipulating a free press, accepting bribes, and trading government favors. The allegations against Prime Minister Netanyahu are serious and cut to the heart of a functioning democracy."
My friend @AyannaPressley is our first African American congresswoman in Massachusetts. Ayanna has been our champion for women and families here in Boston for years—and now she’s showing the world that #ChangeCantWait. #BlackHistoryMonth
"We’re building our campaign one grassroots donation at a time. Tonight’s our first monthly fundraising deadline since I announced that I’m running for president — will you make a donation of $3, or whatever you can, to own a piece of this movement?"

"The Trump era is awash with corruption—and yesterday made that perfectly clear. If I’m elected President of the United States, there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in these investigations."
"About 8 years ago, Bruce and I met a young man who I remember to this day. His words still give me goosebumps."
"Voter suppression is real – just look at the corruption in Georgia during the 2018 election. We need to overturn every last voter suppression law that keeps people of color from voting, and we need a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote for everyone."
"Tonight, I’m calling people all across the country including Joe, a graduate student from Iowa who chipped in $25."
Today proved – once again – that the Trump administration is the most nakedly corrupt leadership this nation has seen in our lifetimes. #EndCorruptionNow
"Donald Trump shouldn’t use his power to shield his friends from justice. And the next President shouldn’t protect them, either. Or him."
"Let me be clear: If I’m elected President, there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in these investigations — and everyone who might succeed Trump should adopt the same policy, starting with Vice President @Mike_Pence. Add your name if you agree:"
"The pardon and clemency powers are supposed to be about granting mercy to the powerless, not immunity for the powerful. The next President should promise: No pardons or commutations for any person implicated as part of a federal criminal investigation related to Donald Trump."
"But here’s the biggest threat right now: Donald Trump, or the next President, using the pardon power to cover up and permanently excuse this wrongdoing."
"Our criminal justice system is hanging on and doing its job – the truth is coming out – despite unprecedented, relentless, and potentially illegal pressure from Donald Trump and his associates in and out of government."
Donald Trump and his associates are trying to sabotage our criminal justice system. Read my full break-down here:
"34 individuals and 3 companies have been indicted, convicted, or pled guilty. And now Michael Cohen – who’s been involved in everything he’s done for decades including his time in the White House – has confessed to breaking the law on Trump’s behalf."
"Michael Cohen, one of Donald Trump’s most trusted advisors, just implicated him in criminal activity while he’s been in the White House. It’s the most descriptive account of illegal acts committed by Donald Trump and the people working for him."
"I’m running my campaign on the principle of equal access for anyone who joins it. No fancy receptions or big money fundraisers. Just donate what you can, when you can. And if you get a call from an unknown number, pick up: Because it just might be me calling to say thank you."
My new plan is simple – and the first of its kind in the country. Universal child care. For every family who wants it. Paid for by taxing the ultra-rich 0.1%. Let’s do this. #UniversalChildCare
"Last night I talked to Sophie, a teacher who chipped in $25 to my campaign. Sophie cares a lot about her students and she’s fighting for their futures. I promised her: We’re going to make this work for all our kids."

Jeannie is a nurse who watched me on @allinwithchris tonight – and then chipped in to our campaign! She told me that she got in this fight to protect our environment and level the playing field. I’m glad to have her on our team.

"As a candidate for president, the expectation is you make hours of calls with wealthy donors a week, and attend dozens of exclusive events every quarter. I told @chrislhayes: I’m saying no to that. This is an equal access campaign for everyone who wants to be part of it."
"In just a few minutes, you can catch me on @allinwithchris on @MSNBC. See you soon, @chrislhayes!"
We shouldn’t be denying our kids the kind of care and early learning they need to fulfill their potential. #UniversalChildCare
I’ll be on @allinwithchris tonight at 8:00 PM ET to discuss my announcement about how my time is not for sale. I hope you’ll tune in.
Big Pharma executives need to be held accountable for the opioid crisis that’s squeezing our country. My new bill with Rep. Elijah Cummings does just that – and provides communities with the resources they need to tackle the epidemic head on.
"Couldn’t explain it better myself, @hasanminhaj. That’s why @janschakowsky and I proposed the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act – a plan to bring competition to the generic drug market by publicly manufacturing generic drugs."
Woo-hoo! Congratulations to Massachusetts’ own @iamRuthECarter on her history-making Best Costume Design #Oscars win for #BlackPanther last night.
"When I first ran for Senate, we had a t-shirt naming contest. The winner was, “The Best Senator Money Can’t Buy.” Today we announced that our presidential campaign will run on that same principle of equal access – & we brought back the shirt, with a twist."
"With two words, @TaranaBurke made history – and made room for generations of survivors to share their stories. #BlackHistoryMonth"
"Make a donation – of any amount – and know that no matter what you’re able to contribute, you’ll be on equal footing with every single other donor to this campaign."
But I believe the biggest risk in this election is failing to empower the millions of people who feel the squeeze of an economy rigged against them and the deep frustration of a failing political system that produced Donald Trump in the first place. So let’s change it.
"There are some Democrats who are so deeply afraid of losing to Donald Trump that they don’t want to risk saying or doing anything different at all. Even if they agree that we need big, structural change, they see challenging the status quo as an electoral risk."
"If we build our campaign person to person, town to town, all across this country, it means we’ll win up and down the ballot in 2020. And we’ll have the power to make big, structural changes in 2021."
"On our campaign, there’ll be no event you’ll be excluded from because you can’t afford it, and no better seats or 1:1 time with me at events if you can. What you donate shouldn’t determine the amount of time you get to spend with a candidate. My plan:"
"It’s been estimated that up to 70% of a congressional candidate’s time is spent with potential wealthy donors. It’s safe to assume that goes for presidential campaigns too, and presidential donors are disproportionately white, male, and wealthy. We have to do things differently."
"Let’s call out something that usually goes unspoken: Presidential candidates spend way too much time with wealthy donors. For every time you see a presidential candidate talking with voters, they’re spending three or four times as long with wealthy donors behind closed doors."
"I’ve already said that I'll run my campaign differently – no Washington lobbyist money, no dark money, no super PACs. But today, I’m going further. My presidential primary campaign will be run on the principle of equal access for anybody who joins it."
"Thank you for chipping in, Annette! (If you get a call from an unlisted number tonight, pick up, because it just might be a call from me)."

I believe them.
Child care should be a fundamental right. Period. Here’s how my #UniversalChildCare plan would make that a reality.
"More proof that Donald Trump’s #GOPTaxScam was a big fat lie. Wages for workers barely budge, while corporate profits soar. It’s time to give workers a raise."
"Thanks again for having me, @PodSaveAmerica. You can listen to my full interview with @TVietor08 now."
"1. Stop subsidizing fossil fuel companies
2. Put that money into green energy

I’m in all the way for a #GreenNewDeal."
"If there were ever a moment in history that proved we need more women in leadership roles, it's now. Women understand why it matters to fight for the underdog. And we're not afraid of a fight – not even the hard ones."
"In 1960, when it was legal to discriminate against families of color, the gap between white and black families' homeownership rates was 27%. Today, that gap is 30% – bigger than it was when housing discrimination was actually legal.

Race matters – and we need to call it out."
"From leading @TheKingCenter to carrying on her family’s legacy of racial justice and equality, @BerniceKing is a messenger of peace. She inspires me – and the world – to act with love and reject hate. #BlackHistoryMonth"
I talked to @cenkuygur on @TheYoungTurks about why we need to let Robert Mueller finish his investigation – on his own terms – and release his full report.
"Happy Birthday to my friend and a true American hero, Rep. John Lewis. John inspires us all to fight for what’s right – no matter how hard that fight may be. I’m honored to make #GoodTrouble alongside you."
"My big chance was a commuter college that cost $50 a semester. Today, America has saddled our young people with $1.5 trillion of student loan debt. We’re crushing an entire generation – and we need to stop before it’s too late."

Our candidates should be held to the highest standards of accountability. That’s why I proposed a plan to #EndCorruptionNow. That's why I put 10 years of my tax returns online. And that's why our movement is powered by grassroots supporters – not federal lobbyists or Super PACs.
"A majority of Americans – Democrats and Republicans alike – want the rich and powerful to pay their fair share. A majority of Americans want real, structural change like my #UltraMillionaireTax."
"Last night, I told @JKCorden and @50cent that we have a chance for real, structural change in 2020. And that includes my new plan for #UniversalChildCare."
We need #UniversalChildCare that's high-quality and affordable – no parent should have to choose between breaking the budget or settling for lower-quality care. My new plan would help American families out of that bind.
"Only Mueller should decide when his investigation is complete. And when he's done, the public should see his full report. Not a summary. Full stop."
One of my favorite parts about being on the road is taking pictures (and getting hugs!) from people all across this country. Here's what my first full day in Iowa as a candidate for President of the United States looked like.
"Universal Child Care, my In-N-Out order, and tattoos. Covered a lot of ground on the @latelateshow last night with @50cent (and grandkids are jealous I got to meet @ArianaGrande!)"
"Right now, high-quality child care is a privilege for the rich. I believe it should be a fundamental right for everyone. We need #UniversalChildCare."
"Donald Trump’s ridiculous wall isn’t a “national emergency.” But our country’s opioid crisis is. Rep. Elijah @ReElectCummings and I are proposing big, structural change to fix it."
"In less than an hour, tune in to watch my interview with @JKCorden on @thelatelateshow!"
"I was glad to talk with @TheYoungTurks crew today. I’m fighting for big, structural change – and it starts at the grassroots level with all of us fighting together."
"Thanks for having me, @PodSaveAmerica! It was great to talk with @TVietor08 about my 2020 agenda, and I love-love-loved meeting @jonfavs and @jonlovett’s dogs (don’t tell Bailey). Tune in to Thursday’s episode to hear our conversation."
Hope you can stay up to catch me on the @latelateshow with @JKCorden tonight! We'll talk about my new plan for #UniversalChildCare and more. Tune in to @CBS at 12:35 AM ET.
"We need real, structural change to protect our environment – and we need it now."
"I remember calling my Aunt Bee and breaking down, telling her between tears that I couldn’t make it work and had to quit my job. Then Aunt Bee said 11 words that changed my life: “I can’t get there tomorrow, but I can come on Thursday.” #UniversalChildCare"
The @NRA works around the clock to buy off or bully members of Congress and gut opportunities for real gun reform. I'm not afraid to fight back and I won't take a dime of the NRA’s money.
"Donald Trump's ridiculous ""national emergency"" is illegal. We need to fight this with everything we’ve got."
"Our kids are our future – but right now, we’re shortchanging them. Add your name to the petition: Every kid aged 0 to 5 in America should have access to high-quality, affordable child care and early learning. #UniversalChildCare"
"Under my new plan, we'll:
☑️Partner with local providers  to create a network of child care options
☑️Put communities in charge & hold providers to high standards
☑️Pay child care & preschool workers like comparable public school teachers
☑️Pay for it with my #UltraMillionaireTax"
"My new plan quadruples the federal investment in child care and early education, and offers high-quality options completely free to millions of families. Every kid in America deserves a fair shot at success."
Our candidates should be held to the highest standards of accountability. That’s why I proposed a plan to #EndCorruptionNow. That's why I put 10 years of my tax returns online. And that's why our movement is powered by grassroots supporters – not federal lobbyists or Super PACs.
"A majority of Americans – Democrats and Republicans alike – want the rich and powerful to pay their fair share. A majority of Americans want real, structural change like my #UltraMillionaireTax."
"Last night, I told @JKCorden and @50cent that we have a chance for real, structural change in 2020. And that includes my new plan for #UniversalChildCare."
We need #UniversalChildCare that's high-quality and affordable – no parent should have to choose between breaking the budget or settling for lower-quality care. My new plan would help American families out of that bind.
"Only Mueller should decide when his investigation is complete. And when he's done, the public should see his full report. Not a summary. Full stop."
One of my favorite parts about being on the road is taking pictures (and getting hugs!) from people all across this country. Here's what my first full day in Iowa as a candidate for President of the United States looked like.
"Universal Child Care, my In-N-Out order, and tattoos. Covered a lot of ground on the @latelateshow last night with @50cent (and grandkids are jealous I got to meet @ArianaGrande!)"
"Right now, high-quality child care is a privilege for the rich. I believe it should be a fundamental right for everyone. We need #UniversalChildCare."
"Donald Trump’s ridiculous wall isn’t a “national emergency.” But our country’s opioid crisis is. Rep. Elijah @ReElectCummings and I are proposing big, structural change to fix it."
"In less than an hour, tune in to watch my interview with @JKCorden on @thelatelateshow!"
"I was glad to talk with @TheYoungTurks crew today. I’m fighting for big, structural change – and it starts at the grassroots level with all of us fighting together."
"Thanks for having me, @PodSaveAmerica! It was great to talk with @TVietor08 about my 2020 agenda, and I love-love-loved meeting @jonfavs and @jonlovett’s dogs (don’t tell Bailey). Tune in to Thursday’s episode to hear our conversation."
Hope you can stay up to catch me on the @latelateshow with @JKCorden tonight! We'll talk about my new plan for #UniversalChildCare and more. Tune in to @CBS at 12:35 AM ET.
"We need real, structural change to protect our environment – and we need it now."
"I remember calling my Aunt Bee and breaking down, telling her between tears that I couldn’t make it work and had to quit my job. Then Aunt Bee said 11 words that changed my life: “I can’t get there tomorrow, but I can come on Thursday.” #UniversalChildCare"
The @NRA works around the clock to buy off or bully members of Congress and gut opportunities for real gun reform. I'm not afraid to fight back and I won't take a dime of the NRA’s money.
"Donald Trump's ridiculous ""national emergency"" is illegal. We need to fight this with everything we’ve got."
"Our kids are our future – but right now, we’re shortchanging them. Add your name to the petition: Every kid aged 0 to 5 in America should have access to high-quality, affordable child care and early learning. #UniversalChildCare"
"Under my new plan, we'll:
☑️Partner with local providers  to create a network of child care options
☑️Put communities in charge & hold providers to high standards
☑️Pay child care & preschool workers like comparable public school teachers
☑️Pay for it with my #UltraMillionaireTax"
"My new plan quadruples the federal investment in child care and early education, and offers high-quality options completely free to millions of families. Every kid in America deserves a fair shot at success."
"Child care should be a fundamental right, period. I remember how hard it was to find affordable, high-quality child care for my two kids when I was a working mom – and it's a zillion times harder today. Here’s how my #UniversalChildCare plan works."
"Another big, structural change we need: #UniversalChildCare. I’m proposing a bold new plan that guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child in America. It will be free for millions of families, and affordable for everyone."
"This did, too."
This got a huge applause tonight:
"Watch live as I discuss my #UniversalChildCare plan. Child care should be a right, not a privilege for the rich."
"I’ll never give up on your kids and grandkids, and I’ll never give up on their futures. That’s a promise."
"This is corruption – plain and simple. When my #EndCorruptionNow bill becomes law, no more side-stepping the rules. It will be illegal for @RyanZinke – and everyone else – to go right from the White House to a big lobbying job."
I stand with the thousands of people across the country who are making their voices heard and fighting the #FakeTrumpEmergency. A fake “national emergency” at the border is fear-mongering of the worst kind – and we’re not falling for it.
"MA-born artist and critic Lorraine O’Grady has broken barriers in an industry dominated by white men. Her powerfully important paintings and performances have paved the way for other African American women artists, and give a voice to the voiceless. #BHM"
I’m pretty sure our #Warren2020 Official Good Boy had a great time in Lawrence last weekend.
It’s time for Democrats to declare who we are. We are the party of the people. We are the party that believes that every kid should get a fighting chance to build a future. We're going to take 2020 as our chance to build a movement and change this country for the better.
"Our fight is to change the rules so that our government, our economy, and our democracy work for everyone in Nevada and across the country."
"Just touched down in Las Vegas. See you soon, Nevada!"
Aretha Franklin will always command respect. She defined decades of history – singing at MLK’s funeral and President Obama’s inauguration – and inspires us to keep fighting for civil rights and equality. #BHM
"We’re fighting for big, structural change in this country and that includes making real investments in childcare."
"We need to take power away from the wealthy and well-connected and put it back in the hands of the people – in South Carolina, Georgia, and everywhere else."
"Back when I was a kid, a minimum-wage job could support a family of three. Today, a full-time minimum-wage job in America won’t keep a mama and a baby out of poverty. Our movement is about making real, fundamental change to fix this."
"Hello, Greenville! Great to be back in South Carolina this morning."
The #FakeTrumpEmergency is an abuse of power. Full stop.
"Today, at least five people were killed and several first responders were injured in a mass shooting in Aurora, Illinois. I’m heartsick for the victims, their loved ones, and the brave Aurora Police Department. #GunReformNow"

"The majority of Americans – Democrats, Republicans, and independents – support my #UltraMillionaireTax plan to start rebuilding our middle class. People are tired of a government that only works for the rich and powerful."
These credible and troubling allegations from Dr. Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson make it clear that Lt. Gov Fairfax should resign. My heart goes out to these brave women and their families.

Middle-class families are sick of stagnant wages & exploding costs. They're sick of a Washington that works only for the wealthy & the well-connected. They don't want to replace a self-absorbed billionaire President with another one. Americans want real change. We should listen.

This year the wealthiest top 0.1% in America are projected to owe 3.2% of their wealth in taxes. The bottom 99% are projected to owe 7.2%. My new #UltraMillionaireTax helps level the playing field by asking the 0.1% to pay their fair share.

"One month ago today, we launched this exploratory committee to build a grassroots movement to level the playing field. On Sat, February 9, I’ll be making a BIG announcement about my 2020 plans. Sign up now to be the first to know where I'll be making it."
Our children & grandchildren should grow up in a world where they can breathe the air & drink the water – and go outside without risking their lives in extreme temperatures. It’s time to protect our planet & pass a Green New Deal. #PolarVortex2019
Working people can't afford to hire armies of lobbyists & lawyers – but giant corporations & powerful interests can & do. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would end lobbying as we know it so our government works for the people.
Why do the richest top 0.1% of Americans own almost as much wealth as 90% of America? I’ll tell you exactly how that happened. And how my #UltraMillionaireTax would make sure everybody’s kids get a chance to succeed – not just those at the tippy top.
This hedge fund billionaire bought a penthouse for a quarter-billion dollars. Think he could pay my new #UltraMillionaireTax so that middle-class families – like the ones who got evicted so his penthouse could be built – can pay less for childcare?
What exactly does @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell have against more Americans voting? Of course Congress should make it easier for Americans to vote on Election Day. And we need a constitutional amendment establishing a nationally recognized right to vote.
"Extreme temperatures. Monster storms. Donald Trump & the GOP might not believe in science, but I do. We need to make fundamental changes to stop climate change – like passing a Green New Deal in Congress – and save our planet."
"I had a great time at our organizing event in Columbia – where I got asked a question I’d never been asked before. Thank you, South Carolina! Be back soon."
The richest tippy-top 0.1% of Americans have nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90%. That’s bad for our economy & our democracy. I talked with @chrislhayes about how my #UltraMillionaireTax would ask the 0.1% to pay their fair share and rebuild the middle class.
"The day @realDonaldTrump’s bigoted Muslim ban started will be seared in my brain forever. But so will what happened next: the sea of people rushing to airports, & everyone in Boston & nationwide that spoke out against hate. 2 yrs later, we won't forget, & we won't stop fighting."
"Woo-hoo! @staceyabrams is a leader, a fighter, & a terrific choice to deliver the Democratic response to the State of the Union address on February 5. I’m glad everyone will have the chance to hear her powerful voice."
"Racism, homophobia, & all forms of bigotry & hate have no place in this country. The fight for equality isn’t over – no one should have to live in fear of being beaten on the street because of who they are."
This is what happens when you challenge the rich and powerful. They'll fight tooth and nail against anyone who stands up to them. But we need structural change to get our economy and our democracy back on track - and no billionaire is going to get in my way of fighting for it.
Billionaires like Howard Schultz & Michael Bloomberg want to keep a rigged system in place that benefits only them and their buddies. And they plan to spend gobs of cash to try and buy the Presidency to keep it that way. Not on my watch.
Billions of dollars have been flushed down the drain for a completely unnecessary political stunt. How many schools & roads & bridges could have been fixed? How many scientists could have gotten their research funded? How many seniors could have had a hot lunch?
"What's “ridiculous” is billionaires who think they can buy the presidency to keep the system rigged for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. The top 0.1%, who'd pay my #UltraMillionaireTax, own about the same wealth as 90% of America. It's time for change."

"Let’s start #BlackHistoryMonth by honoring Fannie Lou Hamer: a fierce civil rights leader. Fannie Lou championed women’s rights, voting rights & workers' rights. She endured violence to help thousands of people register to vote & fight illegal segregation."
"#BlackHistoryMonth starts today: a time to honor African Americans and their powerfully important contributions to our country. All month, we’ll be celebrating black women & the barriers they've broken – often in the face of systemic racism."

Our children & grandchildren should grow up in a world where they can breathe the air & drink the water – and go outside without risking their lives in extreme temperatures. It’s time to protect our planet & pass a Green New Deal. #PolarVortex2019
Working people can't afford to hire armies of lobbyists & lawyers – but giant corporations & powerful interests can & do. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would end lobbying as we know it so our government works for the people.

"Our economy is rigged against working people – & especially rigged against people of color. The wealthy & well-connected have enormous power in Washington. It’s time to make real, structural change to our economy, our govt & our politics to fix it."
"CEOs should be held personally accountable when they cheat & bring the economy to its knees. No bank should be too big to fail. And if you’re among the top 0.1% of America's richest households, you should pay your fair share in taxes so we can rebuild our middle class."
It turns out the big bank CEOs & the executives on Wall Street are scared that we want to hold them accountable & make them pay their fair share. Good. They should be. And here’s why:
Billionaires like this guy make me wonder what our country needs more of: ranches with golf courses designed by PGA players & fireplaces “imported from European castles” – or universal childcare & a Green New Deal? #UltraMillionaireTax
"We need to invest in clean energy, lead the fight on climate change, & stop giving tax breaks to Big Oil. And one more thing: it should be illegal for former coal lobbyists like @EPAAWheeler to run the EPA. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, it would."
"Every day, 8 children & teenagers die from #gunviolence. It makes me heartsick. Time for Congress to pass common-sense gun reforms to make Americans safe – not cozy up to the @NRA and do nothing."

"I’ve been in this fight for pretty much my whole life – not because it poll-tested well, but because it’s clear that we’ve got to level the playing field for working people. It’s going to take all of us to make real change."
We fought hard to save the Affordable Care Act in 2017 & elect a House majority in November that would protect health care. But the Trump admin is still working behind the scenes to gut #Medicaid.

No one should have to choose between medical care & stretching their last paycheck. #TrumpShutdown
The ultra-rich have rigged our economy & rigged our tax rules. We need structural change. That’s why I’m proposing something brand-new: An annual wealth tax on the tippy-top 0.1%. We’d get $3 trillion in new revenue to invest in rebuilding the middle-class. Let’s make it happen.
"Had a great time talking with @chrislhayes tonight. If you agree the ultra-rich should pay their fair share, sign our petition."
Tonight I’ll be on @allinwithchris at 8 PM ET to talk with @chrislhayes about my new Ultra-Millionaire Tax. I hope you’ll tune in!
It would make the ultra-rich pay their fair share & generate nearly $3 trillion over the next 10 years. A lot of rich and powerful people won’t like it – but I don’t work for them. Sign our petition if you agree: It’s time to tax the wealth of the top 0.1%

"Congratulations @UTLAnow & LAUSD teachers! You got organized, persisted, & made real change for public schools & students. We'll stay in this fight so every kid gets a chance at a good education & every teacher gets the respect & support they deserve."
"While @realDonaldTrump yells about his dumb wall, 800,000 workers & their families are on the ropes – & are about to miss their second paycheck. 

Enough is enough. Time to end #TrumpShutdown."
"We had an incredible organizing event in Columbia, South Carolina last night. I’m very grateful to everyone who came out to talk about how we build we a future — not just for some of our kids, but for all of our kids. We’re building something special here."
I was glad to be back in Puerto Rico with @CarmenYulinCruz & friends last night. It’s time for our government to show the people of PR some respect – and we can start by taking real steps to get on the road to recovery from the twin catastrophes of hurricanes & vulture debt.
"Right here in Puerto Rico, our federal government is taking money off the island in order to send it to Wall Street – and cut services, health care services & schools. I talked about this & more on @AC360 last night. Watch our interview."
.@realDonaldTrump & the Republicans are making a choice to keep survivors of domestic abuse in danger rather than reopen our government. #TrumpShutdown
Tonight we held a community conversation in San Juan about the dignity & respect that Puerto Rico deserves from our government. Read my remarks here:
"We won’t go back – not now, not ever."
Puerto Rico gets a lot less #Medicaid funding than states – which means some US citizens in PR can’t access life-saving medical care. That's why I’m calling for hearings & fighting for legislation to provide Medicaid parity in PR & other US territories.
I’m in Puerto Rico today to talk about the island’s recovery. First stop: @uprrp to talk with students about their challenges to build a future for themselves & their families.
"This was fun! Sue & Pauline each donated to support our grassroots movement, and I got to surprise them both and say thanks. This is how we build change – one person at a time."
"Nearly 3,000 US citizens died in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria – and @realDonaldTrump's response has been a disgrace. From long-term housing assistance to a comprehensive debt relief plan, I'm fighting to help the island get back on its feet."
"Banning troops based on gender identity is unconstitutional & makes us less safe. If someone enlists & can handle the job, they should be allowed to serve. I’ll fight tooth & nail until trans Americans are free to be themselves & serve their country without discrimination."
"Over time, America realized that the killer could kill the dreamer – but he could not kill the dream. The killer could kill the fighter, but he could not kill the fight. We are the heirs of Dr. King’s dream & soldiers in his fight."
Democrats can do our part to stop the corrupting influence of money in politics by linking arms & pledging to run grassroots campaigns in the 2020 presidential primary. Disavow Super PACs & say no to self-funding. Add your name to show your support.

It made no sense for Bruce & me to get a puppy. But the heart wants what the heart wants. And now we have Bailey – the official Good Boy of our grassroots movement. He makes our hearts happy.
"Thank you, Claremont! Bruce, Bailey, & I had an incredible evening at our second New Hampshire organizing event. We had a great conversation about student loans, immigration reform, families separated at the border, and so much more."
"For 27 days, hundreds of thousands of workers & their families have been left in limbo. They don’t know when their next paycheck will come. They’re fighting to scrape by. The #TrumpShutdown needs to end."
15/10 official Good Boy?
Getting slicked up for our second NH organizing event in Claremont tonight!
"Mrs. Lee, my 2nd grade teacher at Wilson Elementary in Norman, OK, changed my whole world. We must invest in our teachers & students – & that means investing in our public schools. I’m with @UTLAnow & LAUSD teachers so all students get a chance to succeed."
This was never just about the US census. This is just one more example of @realDonaldTrump & Republicans fanning the flames of bigotry & fear. I’m glad to hear that a federal judge ruled against adding a last-minute citizenship question to the 2020 Census.
"By creating low-fee index funds, Jack Bogle saved working Americans hundreds of billions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to Wall Street. A man after my own heart. RIP."
"I had a lot of fun at @ManchesterCC for our first organizing event in New Hampshire last weekend. We’re building a grassroots movement to make big, structural changes in Washington & rebuild the middle class – and this time, we’ll build it for everybody."
.@realDonaldTrump is laying groundwork to fire Robert Mueller. First he cleaned house at @TheJusticeDept. Now he wants to confirm an AG who expressed bias against the Mueller investigation. The Senate must reject William Barr & protect this investigation.
"Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment 40+ years ago, but it was never ratified by enough states. That could change. I support extending the deadline to ratify the ERA. It’s long past time for women’s equal rights to be recognized in our Constitution."
The #GOPTaxScam was a big wet kiss to giant banks & multinational corporations – & now Republicans want to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block. That’s why I’m in this fight: to level the playing field.
"Trump's @DepSecDef Shanahan spent decades at a big Pentagon contractor before becoming acting secretary. That should be illegal. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, contractors would be banned from working at the agency awarding their contract for 4 years."
"William Barr, @realDonaldTrump’s pick for Attorney General:

-Expressed bias against the Mueller investigation
-Said Roe v Wade was wrongly decided
-Supported efforts to gut the ACA
-Has a terrible record on criminal justice

The Senate should vote NO on his confirmation."
Bailey snoozed all the way home from New Hampshire – campaigning is tiring work for a dog! Check out his view from Saturday's event in Manchester.
Big Pharma is raking in cash on the backs of people with diabetes. Now the #TrumpShutdown is putting people with life-threatening conditions in even more danger. @realDonaldTrump needs to end this – now.
Mamas with babies & no money for next month’s bills. Families dipping into savings. And thousands of workers who are missing paychecks. These #ShutdownStories make it clear: @realDonaldTrump needs to end the #TrumpShutdown now.
"Listening to #ShutdownStories from Americans across the country feels like a punch in the gut. Thousands of federal workers should have gotten their paychecks. Instead, they're just trying to scrape by another day. The #TrumpShutdown is just plain wrong."

Too many college students are already getting crushed by student loan debt. They shouldn’t have to worry about having enough to eat. I worked with @BHCCBoston to request the first-ever report on food insecurity on campuses from GAO. Our students need help.
"I support @UTLAnow & LAUSD teachers who are for fighting for better pay, smaller classes, & better resourced schools for our kids. When we fail our public school teachers, we fail their students – and we fail our future. I’m with our teachers all the way."
"The government should be open. Federal workers are not pawns. They should be doing their jobs and getting paid for their jobs. It’s a leadership problem not just with the Trump administration, but with Mitch McConnell."
Bruce & I will miss Haley House (and their delicious blueberry muffins). We loved stopping there after church and being with friends. We hope to see Haley House reopen soon.
"We know we need big structural change in Washington when the agency charged with protecting the environment is being led by a former coal lobbyist. Let’s call @EPAAWheeler’s role out for what it is: corruption, plain & simple. #EndCorruptionNow"
It’s day 23 of #TrumpShutdown – the longest in our country's history – & hundreds of thousands of federal workers & their families are hurting. @realDonaldTrump needs to end the shutdown so that people can get back to work.
"Hello, New Hampshire! We had a terrific first organizing event at @ManchesterCC this afternoon. New Hampshire is in this fight to level the playing field for working people."
"Great turnout for our first event in Manchester, NH this afternoon!"
Food inspectors make sure our veggies aren’t crawling with deadly bacteria. The #TrumpShutdown is a real crisis for working families – & now it’s a public health crisis. @realDonaldTrump needs to end this shutdown & stop putting people in danger.
"On this day 75 years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a declaration about the rights that all Americans deserve. The fight to guarantee these rights for every American remains unfinished. Now it’s up to all of us."
"Ending government corruption isn’t just a Democratic value. Most people – Democrats, Republicans, & Independents – want a government that works for them. We’re building a grassroots movement to fight that fight."
"We can't let billionaires & giant corporations buy our Democratic primary in 2020. Every Democratic presidential candidate should link arms & pledge to run grassroots campaigns. Disavow Super PACs, & no self-funding. Sign on if you agree."
"I met (and hugged) a lot of great people in Iowa who are ready to fight. New Hampshire, I’m looking forward to meeting you this weekend!"
Our air traffic control workers at Boston Logan & across the country have incredibly important jobs. They shouldn’t be worrying about their paychecks when they’re keeping us safe – and that means @realDonaldTrump needs to end his shameful shutdown.
It’s time to stop corporate interests & dark money from eating away at our democracy. Democrats should show some moral backbone and disavow Super PACs in the 2020 primary.
"Thank you, Iowa, for a terrific three days in Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Storm Lake, Des Moines, and Ankeny! We're building a grassroots movement in Iowa and all across this country to level the playing field for working people. And we’re just getting started."
"Former oil lobbyist David Bernhardt spent much of his career helping to poison the planet. Now he’s running @Interior. When my bill to #EndCorruptionNow is the law, corporate lobbyists like him will be barred from taking a government job for 6 years."
"The Affordable Care Act is still the law of land – but the GOP & @realDonaldTrump are still doing everything they can to kill it. Massachusetts, be sure to sign up for a health plan for 2019. MA residents still have until Jan 23 to #GetCovered at  ."
"Our Coast Guard service members make huge sacrifices to keep the people of MA safe. Under the #TrumpShutdown, they don’t know when their next paycheck will be. It’s a disgrace."
"I brought my guys, Bruce and Bailey, to Manchester for our first organizing meeting in New Hampshire. Thanks to everyone who spent their Saturday afternoon with us! This is how we do this -- neighbor to neighbor."
Too many college students are already getting crushed by student loan debt. They shouldn’t have to worry about having enough to eat. I worked with @BHCCBoston to request the first-ever report on food insecurity on campuses from GAO. Our students need help.
"I support @UTLAnow & LAUSD teachers who are for fighting for better pay, smaller classes, & better resourced schools for our kids. When we fail our public school teachers, we fail their students – and we fail our future. I’m with our teachers all the way."

I loved being in Iowa. The people I met last weekend are ready to jump in this fight all the way. We’re dreaming big & fighting hard. It’s how we’ll make real change – and we’re doing it all at the grassroots.
"Corporate interests win when politicians like Jon Kyl bounce between government & big business lobbying firms. My #EndCorruptionNow bill bans lobbying for former Members of Congress – not for a year or two, but for the rest of their lives."
"I met a lot of people in Iowa this weekend: mamas and babies, union workers, immigrants, students (and a whole lot of huggers). They keep me going."
"Hundreds of thousands of federal workers & their families are hurting, and it’s only getting worse. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to stop playing politics with people’s lives and end the #TrumpShutdown."
In Council Bluffs I talked about Medicaid. We don't know whose grandma will outlive her savings. We don't know whose baby will have $1M in medical bills. Medicaid says: we don’t know who is going to need help – but we’ll all pitch in some nickels & the rest of us will be there.
"The current administration didn't cause the rot in Washington – they’re just the worst example of it. We need a government that works for the people again, not for the rich & the powerful."
Two & a half weeks can make it or break it for many working families. And now thousands of federal employees & their families are dipping into their savings & putting off bills. @realDonaldTrump needs to end his shameful #TrumpShutdown.
"We need to padlock the revolving door between big business & government – just look at @realDonaldTrump’s crooked cabinet. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, lobbyists wouldn’t be able to jump right to a spot in the government."
"We had a terrific discussion with women leaders in Ankeny this past weekend about why we ran for office and what keeps us fighting. It’s women like them, and the hundreds of women that joined us on Sunday, that inspire me to keep fighting."
I’m glad that AG @Maura_Healey can continue to investigate whether @ExxonMobil broke consumer & investor protection laws by misleading people about climate change. We must hold big oil companies accountable. I’ll fight alongside her every step of the way.
"After 6 months, I’m glad that @nationalgridus finally ended the lockout so @usw04 workers can go back to work. When workers unionize & make their voices heard, workers win."
"I was very glad to hear from leaders in Storm Lake, IA this weekend about how our government can be a better partner for the working people they fight for."
"Don’t forget, Massachusetts! January 23 is the last day to enroll in health care & #GetCovered in 2019. See if you qualify for financial help at  ."
"Good morning, Des Moines! Stopped by Smokey Row this morning to say hello."
"Thank you, Des Moines! Let’s dream big and fight hard."
People stretched around three city blocks last night to attend our first organizing event in Des Moines. This is what a grassroots movement to level the playing field looks like.
Democracy is restorative.
The line for our Des Moines organizing event stretches three blocks!

Thank you Council Bluffs for the INCREDIBLE welcome to Iowa tonight. We’re just getting started!
"First event in Iowa, first overflow line in Iowa!"
We need a lifetime ban on lobbying for members of Congress. And fix the swiss cheese def of “lobbying” so anyone who gets paid to influence Washington has to register. Public service shouldn’t be a launching pad for guys like @TGowdySC & @JoeLieberman to enrich themselves.
".@TGowdySC foamed at the mouth with power in Congress, then retired because he claimed he didn't enjoy it. Now it’s clear: Trey Gowdy just wanted a fat lobbyist paycheck. That should be illegal."
"The federal deadline to sign up for health insurance has passed – but not the MA deadline! Massachusetts, you have until January 23 to #GetCovered or pick a new health plan and #StayCovered in 2019. Head to   before it’s too late."
"This resistance began with women, & today our voices were heard. Congrats to @SpeakerPelosi & the incredible, historic class of women sworn in today (including @AyannaPressley & @LoriUSCongress). It’s an honor to fight alongside you."
"After 6 months, I’m hopeful that @nationalgridus will #endthelockout now. When workers come together in a union, they gain power to fight for better wages & benefits – and I'm fighting alongside @Usw04 National Grid workers so they can get back to work."
Giant drug companies only care about one thing: raking in profits on the backs of patients. Mergers that mean more money for drug company CEOs while patients pay the price are not a solution to skyrocketing drug costs.
We cannot allow billionaires & giant corporations to buy our Democratic primary. Tonight I told Rachel @Maddow: Every Democratic candidate for President in 2020 should link arms & pledge to run grassroots campaigns funded by the people. Disavow Super PACs & self funding.
Thanks for tuning in to Rachel @Maddow! This has always been a grassroots campaign – & we need you with us from the beginning. Sign up to be part of our fight:
"In just a few minutes, I’ll be live with Rachel @Maddow on @MSNBC. I’m looking forward to talking about our fight to rebuild the middle class so that everyone gets a fighting chance. Tune in!"
Corruption in Washington isn't about a single president or political party.  It runs deep. We should call it out – & we should pass my sweeping anti-corruption reforms to clamp down on all the ways giant companies drown govt in money to get their way.
"We need a lifetime ban on Members of Congress working as lobbyists to make sure they only serve the public. We need a ban on foreign lobbying so countries like China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have to conduct their foreign policy out in the open. I've proposed both."
ZTE is a giant foreign telecom company that's close with the Chinese govt. They've violated serious U.S. sanctions on Iran & N. Korea. Their lobbyists keep blocking accountability. And today former Senator @JoeLieberman joined them. Should that be legal? No.
I hear women candidates are most likable in the quiet car! I’ll be talking again on @maddow @ 9pm ET.
Tonight I’m talking to Rachel @Maddow at 9 PM ET on @MSNBC about this new chapter in our grassroots fight to put political power back in the hands of the American people. I hope you’ll tune in.
"Last night, I joined some of our best volunteers – people from across Massachusetts who have been in this fight from the very beginning – to say THANK YOU. Thank you – and we’re just getting started."
"I was tickled pink to talk to you too, Cindy! Thank you to everyone who’s signed up to volunteer. Be part of this right from the beginning:"
"I called Melinda yesterday, a preschool teacher who gave $10 to our campaign. So if you’re all in, pick up the phone from that unknown number. It might be me!"

I grew up in an America that invested in kids like me. I’m grateful – and I’m determined. That’s why I fight my heart out so that everyone gets a chance at their piece of the American dream.
"Bruce, Bailey & I are heading outside to answer some questions about my big announcement this morning. Tune in here."
"I’ve spent my career standing up to big banks & powerful corporations. We don’t have binders full of bankers & CEOs to call for giant checks to launch this committee. In fact, most of those guys will spend their money somewhere else. That’s ok with me."

"Every person in America should be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules, & take care of themselves & the people they love. That’s what I’m fighting for, & that’s why I’m launching an exploratory committee for president. I need you with me:"
"Under the #TrumpShutdown, critical programs to help victims of sexual assault & domestic abuse are at a standstill. @realDonaldTrump must end the #TrumpShutdown so that Congress can reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act."
"The people sent us to Washington to have their backs – not to play games with their lives. But we’re in Day 8 of the #TrumpShutdown, all because @realDonaldTrump rejected the Senate’s plan to keep the government open. We need a government that works for the people."
Hundreds of thousands of government employees just spent the holiday not knowing when they’ll get their next paycheck. People deserve better than @realDonaldTrump’s broken & corrupt administration – they deserve a government that works for them.
On Christmas – right here in our country – 8-year-old Felipe Alonzo-Gómez was the second child to die under this administration’s watch this month. @DHSgov & @CBP must answer for what happened to Felipe and Jakelin.
Wishing you and your loved ones a very happy holidays and a joyful new year! It’s an honor to fight alongside you.
"Thousands of federal employees are in limbo over the holiday. Authorization for programs to help victims of sexual assault & domestic abuse has expired.

This is what @realDonaldTrump said he'd be ""proud"" to do. #TrumpShutdown"
"Who does the GOP think runs federal buildings across the country? Thousands of janitors, cafeteria workers, security guards, & others who need every paycheck will be hurt by this completely avoidable disaster. I'm thinking of them this holiday season."
.@realDonaldTrump’s tantrum means that hundreds of thousands of people will be celebrating Christmas without knowing when they’ll get their next paycheck.
We’re fighting for a government that works for the people — not a government of bigotry and fear. Decided to get a little inspiration this morning.
.@realDonaldTrump said he would be “proud” to shut down the government. Now critical parts of the US gov & federal employees are getting hurt. Spending billions of taxpayer $ on a stupid wall won’t make our country safer. Let’s be clear: this is a distraction to keep us divided.
"But there’s a reason this is called the #FirstStepAct – & that’s because it doesn’t go nearly far enough. Our criminal justice system is deeply broken & in need of real, systemic change. We will keep fighting until it delivers on the promise of equal justice for all."
"This week the Senate passed the #FirstStepAct, a bipartisan prison & sentencing reform bill. This bill includes important things I’ve fought for, like banning the practice of shackling pregnant prisoners, & other reforms like limiting solitary confinement for juvenile offenders."
"The window for dealing with climate change is rapidly closing. The moment is upon us. We must act, using all of our tools – including all of our foreign policy tools – to bring as many nations with us as possible. That's what global leadership looks like."

Big Pharma will hate my new plan to bring competition to the generic drug market by publicly manufacturing generic drugs. But Congress doesn’t work for giant drug companies – we work for the American people.
"In November, voters took the first step to hold Congress accountable for turning their backs on the American people. Now Congress can do more to help level the playing field, like passing the Accountable Capitalism Act & our plan to #EndCorruptionNow."
I don’t think a single working family in this country should pay more taxes so that big corporations & billionaires can pay less. But that’s what the #GOPTaxScam did –  raising taxes on some middle class families & handing out $1.5 TRILLION in tax giveaways to the ultra wealthy.
"1 year ago today, @realDonaldTrump & Republicans pulled a heist on the American people when they passed the #GOPTaxScam. 

They said it would would help working families. Then they stole money from the middle class to help their billionaire donors instead."
"There's a real problem with our economy. For decades, workers have helped create record corporate profits, but their wages don’t budge. I’ve got a plan to help fix this – & @replynch, @RepBrendanBoyle, @RepSchakowsky, @peopleforben, & @markpocan are fighting for it in the House."
Let’s be real: brand-name drugs aren’t the only problem with prescription prices. The generic drug market is broken too. It’s time to fix it to increase competition in the generic market. We can start with my new Affordable Drug Manufacturing plan.
"Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with our American values. It is a threat to American safety and security, and we must not tolerate it in the United States of America."
"Anyone can file frivolous ethics complaints, which is exactly what FACT did to me & @KamalaHarris. But this Koch-funded hit squad is silent about the most corrupt Administration in history. Don't be distracted by junk – join my effort to #EndCorruptionNow."
".@realDonaldTrump's laughably unqualified acting AG Matt Whitaker got rich running FACT, a right-wing ""chop shop of fake ethics complaints."" Whitaker has taken his hackery to DOJ, but the chop shop is still taking potshots at me & @KamalaHarris."
"I’m in this fight to:

-Create affordable housing
-#EndCorruptionNow
-Level the playing field for American workers

"Ryan Zinke is leaving the @Interior Dept with a giant pile of ethics investigations. Now he could be replaced by an ex-lobbyist who’s helped pad Big Oil’s pockets by poisoning our planet. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, David Bernhardt wouldn’t get a promotion."
Bruce & I were happy to once again participate in Boston’s Christmas in the City (even if we didn’t win the lightsaber battle). @CITCBoston brings cheer to thousands of little boys & girls & their families who are homeless or living in poverty. We’re glad to be a part of it.
"✅ Fighting government corruption.
✅ Building an economic system that benefits everyone, not just those at the top.
✅ Solving a housing crisis that’s only getting worse. 

We’re taking on some the biggest fights facing working families today."
"Rep @CedricRichmond is in the fight to fix the affordable housing crisis. Thanks for taking the lead in the House, Cedric. Big problems require big solutions. Together, we’re going to make sure families can afford a decent home at a decent price."
"At @MorganStateU on Friday, I talked about how rules matter. Our government has 2 sets of rules: 1 for the wealthy & well-connected, 1 for everyone else. 2 sets of rules: 1 for white families, 1 for everybody else."
Big Pharma is doing everything it can to keep raking in the cash on the backs of people with diabetes. We need to level the playing field for working people with life-threatening conditions who are getting crushed by outrageous drug prices.
"Jakelin Caal Maquin was a little girl younger than my own grandchildren. She died under this administration's watch, right here in this country. What's happening at our borders is immoral & it's getting worse. We need the facts from CBP."
National Grid locked out Massachusetts workers – & families like Kerrie’s have lost their health care for months. We need to #EndTheLockout & give workers the health care & pensions they deserve. I’m fighting with @Usw04 National Grid workers all the way.
"Our democracy is in a tough place, & Democrats will fight to fix it in the new Congress. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow – which was just introduced in the House by @PramilaJayapal & @JohnSarbanes – will help make our government work for everyone again."
"I was honored to join @MorganStateU’s commencement ceremony yesterday. What a great motto they have: “Growing the future, leading the world.” Here’s to you, Class of 2018! You are the future of America, & I’m proud to fight alongside you."
Big Pharma will hate my new plan to bring competition to the generic drug market by publicly manufacturing generic drugs. But Congress doesn’t work for giant drug companies – we work for the American people.
"In November, voters took the first step to hold Congress accountable for turning their backs on the American people. Now Congress can do more to help level the playing field, like passing the Accountable Capitalism Act & our plan to #EndCorruptionNow."
I don’t think a single working family in this country should pay more taxes so that big corporations & billionaires can pay less. But that’s what the #GOPTaxScam did –  raising taxes on some middle class families & handing out $1.5 TRILLION in tax giveaways to the ultra wealthy.
"1 year ago today, @realDonaldTrump & Republicans pulled a heist on the American people when they passed the #GOPTaxScam. 

They said it would would help working families. Then they stole money from the middle class to help their billionaire donors instead."
"There's a real problem with our economy. For decades, workers have helped create record corporate profits, but their wages don’t budge. I’ve got a plan to help fix this – & @replynch, @RepBrendanBoyle, @RepSchakowsky, @peopleforben, & @markpocan are fighting for it in the House."
Let’s be real: brand-name drugs aren’t the only problem with prescription prices. The generic drug market is broken too. It’s time to fix it to increase competition in the generic market. We can start with my new Affordable Drug Manufacturing plan.
"Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with our American values. It is a threat to American safety and security, and we must not tolerate it in the United States of America."
"Anyone can file frivolous ethics complaints, which is exactly what FACT did to me & @KamalaHarris. But this Koch-funded hit squad is silent about the most corrupt Administration in history. Don't be distracted by junk – join my effort to #EndCorruptionNow."
".@realDonaldTrump's laughably unqualified acting AG Matt Whitaker got rich running FACT, a right-wing ""chop shop of fake ethics complaints."" Whitaker has taken his hackery to DOJ, but the chop shop is still taking potshots at me & @KamalaHarris."

-Create affordable housing
-#EndCorruptionNow
-Level the playing field for American workers

Today is the 2019 deadline to enroll in health care for many states. We must keep fighting to protect health care for millions of Americans. Tell your loved ones to sign up TODAY.
The GOP know that they can’t repeal the ACA in Congress. So they’ve continued their crusade through the courts — and a right-wing judge in Texas ruled in their favor. Let’s be very clear: the ACA is still the law of the land.
"The @NRA shut down legislation after Newtown. Day after day, month after month, it keeps happening. School shootings, drive-by shootings, random shootings. Congress does nothing. So we'll keep fighting – for families of #SandyHook & across this country. No compromise on this."
Today is the 6-yr anniversary of the massacre at #SandyHook – a day so many of us will never forget. 26 innocent children & adults were murdered in their classrooms. It felt like we’d finally reached the point as a country that we couldn’t live through another tragedy like that.
"Housing is the biggest expense for most families, and costs everywhere are skyrocketing. My new housing bill would bring down rent by 10% & create 1.5 million new jobs – and @CedricRichmond, @ReElectCummings, @BLeeForCongress & @Gwen4Congress just introduced it in the House."
Americans like Tom are fighters. They play by the rules & bust their tails day after day. But they can’t build a little economic security in a system rigged against them.
".@realDonaldTrump is still trying to kill the Affordable Care Act – & he doesn’t want you to #GetCovered, either. Prove him wrong & sign up for health care before the Dec 15 deadline (Jan 23 in MA). Go to   to learn more."
"My Accountable Capitalism Act was just introduced in the House today by @peopleforben, @markpocan, @replynch, @RepBrendanBoyle, & @RepSchakowsky. It would empower American workers and help get them the higher wages they deserve."
"When workers come together in a union, they gain power to fight for better wages & benefits for themselves & their families. The staff of @DailyHampGaz & the @ValleyAdvocate should be able to unionize and make their voices heard. We’ve got their backs."
Join me in supporting @McCreadyforNC’s fight to to make sure every voter’s voice gets heard in the #NC09 Congressional district. Voting is the beating heart of our democracy. We can’t let anyone’s vote be stolen.
"The evidence is in, and it points to Republicans cheating in #NC09. Democratic House candidate Dan McCready is still fighting back. He needs our help to get to the bottom of this potential election fraud."
"All over Massachusetts, I hear from people whose budgets are getting pushed to the breaking point by the cost of prescription drugs. In Plymouth, I talked about how we can fight back."
Need health insurance? December 15 (& January 23 in MA) is the last day to sign up for health care in many states – head over to   and #GetCovered.
"In WI & MI, Republicans are trying to ram through legislation that would limit the power of incoming Democratic lawmakers & make it harder for people to vote. Our gov’t should work for the people. This goes against everything our democracy stands for."
"While generic drug companies allegedly work behind the scenes to keep drug prices high & pump up their profits, working families are getting crushed. Later this month, I’ll introduce a new bill to help stop this & bring costs down for patients."
We’ve got to responsibly cut back on defense spending. How? Let’s start by ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy. The defense industry will have a seat at the table – but they shouldn’t get to own the table.
"1 year ago today, the people of AL made their voices heard & elected my Democratic colleague in the Senate, @DougJones. About a month ago, we made history again by flipping 40 House seats w/ record turnout. When we fight, Dems can win in every district & state across the country."
"A free press is crucial to vibrant democracies and strong communities across our country & around the world. I’m glad to see journalists recognized & remembered as #TimePOY for their commitment to examine, expose, & report the truth."
"“Not only did the expensive tax cut not bring more jobs, it couldn’t even forestall significant job losses.” In other words, the #GOPTaxScam is an even bigger failure than we thought."
"Democrats are making anti-corruption a top priority in our next Congress. It’s time to #EndCorruptionNow, starting with the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act."

Big money eats away at the heart of our democracy. We must overturn Citizens United. And my Accountable Capitalism Act would require 75% of shareholders & board members to approve corporate political spending so government doesn’t work just for CEOs.

Workers don’t get a fighting chance to succeed when they’re hammered by unfair contracts. Unions built America’s middle class & unions will rebuild America’s middle class by leveling the playing field across the country.
We can start leveling the playing field in the next Congress by passing my new bill to #EndCorruptionNow – the biggest piece of anti-corruption legislation since Watergate. Join our fight.
"Washington works great for the rich & powerful – but it’s not working for everyone else. It’s corruption, plain & simple. On #InternationalAntiCorruptionDay, let’s fight to make our government work for the people again."
"It was great to be in Plymouth today for our 38th town hall. We talked about how we can fight the opioid crisis, lower the cost of prescription drugs, reduce student loan debt, get government working for working people, and more."
"For too long, workers’ wages have stayed flat – even as the giant corporations they work for earn record profits. My bill, the Accountable Capitalism Act, would help level the playing field."
"The @deptvetaffairs should be run by experts who care for our servicemembers – not @realDonaldTrump’s “shadow rulers” hiding out at Mar-a-Lago. This is corruption, plain and simple."
Health care is a basic human right – & we fight for human rights. Make sure you #GetCovered with quality health care coverage. Open enrollment is happening now until December 15 in many states & January 23 in MA.
It’s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan – starting now.
"EPA acting director @AndrewRWheeler – a Big Coal ex-lobbyist – is rolling back climate protections to build coal plants. Under my bill to #EndCorruptionNow, lobbyists wouldn’t be able to go from working Big Coal one day to a job regulating them the next."
"Toys “R” Us workers who lost their jobs & severances banded together to hold the company accountable, & I’m glad to hear that @Sears workers are fighting to do the same. American workers should be treated fairly – not left fighting for crumbs."

Kathy Kraninger's confirmation to lead the @CFPB is another punch in the gut to America's hard-working families. We won't stop fighting to protect the consumer agency & hold big banks accountable when they cheat consumers.

Kathy Kraninger has no experience fighting for consumers & played a role in @realDonaldTrump’s cruel border separation policy. But the Senate GOP want to hand her a big promotion by confirming her to lead the @CFPB tomorrow. Time to speak out & fight back.
Thomas Farr has worked to disenfranchise African Americans & undermine workers' rights. He doesn’t belong anywhere near a federal court bench.   #StopFarr
I was glad to see the @usw04 National Grid workers at yesterday’s hearing on the Merrimack Valley gas explosions. We need these workers back on the job to help the Merrimack Valley recover – and that means it’s time to #EndTheLockout
"Organizations in the Merrimack Valley are providing on-the-ground support to families who are still unable to return to their homes. On this #GivingTuesday, will you help the charities supporting the gas explosion victims in Massachusetts?"
"To the people of MA who have been hurt by the Merrimack Valley gas explosions, I want to say: Yesterday’s hearing was just a first step. We’re going to fight until everyone has been made whole, & so that this never happens in another community again."
"Mississippi – there’s still time to vote for Mike @EspyforSenate today! Polls close in two hours, and as long as you’re in line by 7pm you can still cast your vote. Find your polling place here:   #EspyforSenate #MSsen"
"Before Thomas Farr was @realDonaldTrump’s judicial nominee, he spent much of his career fighting to block people of color from voting. Now the GOP is trying to ram his nomination through the Senate as soon as tomorrow. We need to speak out & fight back."
Not in Mississippi? It’s not too late for us to help Mike @EspyforSenate flip this Mississippi Senate seat. Chip in & show Mike we’ve got his back:   #MSsen #EspyforSenate
"Hello, Mississippi! If you haven’t already, go cast your vote for Mike @EspyforSenate today! Polls are open from 7am-7pm, and you can check your polling place here:   #MSsen #EspyforSenate"
"We feel the effects of climate change all the time here in Massachusetts — extreme temperatures, bigger storms, more flooding. Our wildlife is feeling it, too."
"Today in Lawrence, @edmarkey & I demanded answers about the devastating Merrimack Valley gas explosions in September that killed a young man and displaced thousands of families. @ColumbiaGasMA & @NiSourceInc must be held accountable."

"I’m thankful that @Marriott workers in Boston & across the country won new contracts last week. When working people join together & make their voices heard, we level the playing field so everyone has a fighting chance to succeed."
Shady #4profit colleges were able to suck in taxpayer dollars for years because of an accrediting agency that gave them its rubber stamp – until the Obama admin shut ACICS down. Now @BetsyDeVosED is bringing this disaster back from the dead.
"The GOP is worried we’ll win in Mississippi, just like we won in Alabama last year. They’ve spent over $2M against Mike @EspyforSenate. But it's not too late to chip in & show that we have Mike Espy’s back and will fight all across this country:"
"Mike @EspyForSenate has what it takes to flip the Senate seat in Mississippi’s runoff election tomorrow. Mike has a long record of public service, and he would be a fierce fighter for health care & Social Security. Mississippi needs a Senator who can bring people together. #MSSen"
"Surprise, surprise: A @usedgov audit proves that student loan giant @Navient sabotaged student borrowers – and then lied about it. Navient’s CEO must be held accountable for cheating students & trying to hide it."
We’re not doing enough to fight climate change – and that’s a real & present danger. That’s why I have a new bill to reduce the risk of environmental & financial catastrophe by using market forces to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources.
"Here's @Pfizer’s two-step plan for tackling rising drug prices: 1) “Promise” it won’t raise drug prices, 2) Turn around & raise them anyway. I've got a bill that takes the 1st step in lowering prices by putting a monthly cap on out-of-pocket prescriptions."
"My daughter’s family lives not too far away from the wildfires that have devastated Southern California in recent weeks. Today, we stopped by @LAFD Station 69 to thank them for putting their lives on the line to keep everyone safe."

Happy Thanksgiving from our family to yours!
"Thanksgiving is a time to eat – & a time to celebrate the kindness of strangers, remember our families' sacrifices, & count our many blessings. As Bruce & I gather this morning at our kids’ & grandkids’, I’m more hopeful than ever. Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Instead of spending this week with their families, more than 5,000 American servicemembers are being used as props by @realDonaldTrump at the Mexican border. Our troops deserve better than this."
"In 2016, MA voted to legalize marijuana — and the first sales begin in MA today. States should be able to decide for themselves how to regulate marijuana without federal interference. My bipartisan bill would end the federal ban on marijuana."
"On #TransDayofRemembrance, I’m thinking about those who were killed just for being themselves. At least 22 trans people were killed in the US this year, most women of color. We'll fight back every day until trans people can live w/o fear or discrimination."
My heart hurts for kids who go to school worrying that they might get shot & killed in their classroom. We need common-sense gun reform – & we need it now. No compromises on this one.
I’m heartsick for the victims of the deadly California wildfires & thinking about those who have lost loved ones. To the brave firefighters & emergency responders who are still putting their lives on the line to keep others safe: thank you.
Thomas Farr – @realDonaldTrump's judicial nominee – worked to make it harder for African Americans and communities of color to vote. Now Mitch McConnell is trying to ram Farr’s nomination through the Senate. We have to fight back.
Make no mistake: @EPAAWheeler is a former Big Coal lobbyist who will work to poison the @EPA – and the environment he’s supposed to protect – from the inside out.
"Not long after the 2016 election, I had breakfast with @KatiePorterOC, my former student & research partner. She told me she wanted to do more to fight for working people. Today, Katie is the newest Congresswoman-elect from Orange County, CA. Way to go, Katie!"

"Last week, the people of MA made it clear: Transgender people #WontBeErased & deserve to live free from discrimination. During #TransAwarenessWeek – & every week – I want every trans person to know: You are valued. You are equal. And we are in this fight with you all the way."
"$3.2 MILLION. That’s how much Republican campaigns & right-wing PACs spent at @realDonaldTrump’s hotels & clubs throughout the midterm elections. This is corruption, plain and simple. #EndCorruptionNow"
"I’m proud of all of our incredible incoming Democratic House members, but I’m ESPECIALLY proud of our newest: my former student & research partner @katieporteroc! WOO-HOO! You’re going to be an AMAZING fighter for families in CA & across the country, Congresswoman-elect Porter."
"Mitch McConnell keeps bending over backwards to give @realDonaldTrump & his corrupt administration a pass. But the American people know: Donald Trump isn’t king, & Special Counsel Mueller must continue his investigation without interference."
UPDATE: All 8 of our terrific #NR8 candidates officially won & are headed to Congress to fight for common-sense gun reform.
"Secret backroom deals? Meetings with the NRA & big coal? No, @SecretaryZinke, this isn’t “B.S.” – these are serious ethics scandals. You owe the American people an explanation. #EndCorruptionNow"
Let me be clear: religious discrimination has no place in Massachusetts or anywhere in this country. Our diversity makes us strong. We will fight bigotry and hate so every little girl feels safe & accepted.
Michael @NegronFor47 was an important part of my team & helped me get the Oversight Panel off the ground. I'm proud to see Michael carry on the fight we started ten years ago as a candidate for alderman in Chicago's 47th ward.  Learn more about him here:

It’s not over. @staceyabrams is still fighting her heart out to be a Governor who opens doors for ALL Georgians. Stay in this fight alongside her & help make it happen:
Congratulations to all the women elected to Congress last night (over 100 of you!) Let’s make sure nobody re-writes history: This resistance began with women and it’s being led by women.

I know #PA11 House candidate @jessforcongress walks the walk. She's not taking a penny from corporate PACs. Her campaign for working people relies on grassroots donations – and she’s in striking distance of winning. Let's put Jess King over the top:
"We joined young people across the country in the #marchforourlives. Now we must march to the polls. On Election Day we must stop the corruption, greed, & NRA money that buys our politicians' votes & elect a Congress that will keep our kids safe. I'm in this fight all the way."
"This grassroots army can make a real difference in Jessica @Morse4America’s 4-point House race in #CA04. These last few days are our last chance to flip this seat, & make sure she can fight for health care & an economy that works for everybody:"
The #GoogleWalkout includes fighting for a worker representative on the company Board. My Accountable Capitalism Act would give employees at big American companies the right to elect 40% of the Board – because workers deserve to be heard.
I stand in solidarity with all workers who demand more accountability from their bosses – from National Grid to factories to big tech companies and more. #GoogleWalkout
"We had another terrific rally for @RichCordray, @BettySutton & @Rick_Neal at @ohiou! Rich has always fought for Ohio, and I know that Ohioans are in this fight for Rich."

The GOP have made it clear: repealing the ACA & ripping health care away from millions of people is their top priority. #NY19 needs a rep who will fight tooth & nail for health care. Donate now & let's make sure Antonio @DelgadoforNY19 wins on Nov 6:

Woo-hoo! Tonight is the second debate of our re-election campaign – and there’s a lot of energy here in Springfield.
The race for #IL13 was always close. But now @BetsyForIL is just 1 point away from the GOP incumbent – wow. Betsy is a health care champion & we need her in the House. Pitch in whatever you can now to give her the momentum she needs to win:
Saudi Arabia murdered a journalist. @realDonaldTrump is trying to help them cover it up. Why? Is it because he cares more about stuffing his own pockets with their cash than he does about a free & independent press?
But here's the deal: Gary @TraunerforWY only needs 100K votes to flip the Wyoming Senate seat to a Democrat. I know Gary has what it takes to win on November 6 – but he needs help to keep the momentum up. Donate directly to Gary Trauner's campaign:   #wysen
"Gary @TraunerforWY's Senate race in Wyoming is tightening up. We don't agree on everything, but I know he'll be a strong voice for WY working families. Meanwhile, his GOP opponent John Barrasso voted to repeal the ACA & give tax breaks to billionaires."
This is appalling. @ComericaBank bungled a security breach that allowed fraudsters to steal Social Security payments from some of our most vulnerable citizens. I want answers.
We know who @Abby4Iowa is. She's a fighter for Iowa working families & she won't be bullied by anyone (least of all by @realDonaldTrump). And we know she has what it takes to win #IA01 on Nov 6. Donate directly to Abby's campaign and let's make it happen:

"Millions of people watched you, @realDonaldTrump, as you fumbled and lied on your $1 million pledge. It then took a day for your handlers to tee up this recycled racist name-calling. You’ve lost a step, and in 21 days, you’re going to lose Congress."
"Tick-tock, @realDonaldTrump. November 6th is coming."
"Yeah, @realDonaldTrump will keep insulting me. Let him. We’ll be busy registering voters, knocking on doors, making sure our neighbors know the facts, & telling them about what we're ready to do to build pride, hope, & opportunity all across our country."
"And on November 6, if you’re tired of getting scammed by your President, stand with me, and with the reformers on the ballot in your community, and let’s elect new leadership so we can start getting things back on track in Washington."
"At the end of the day, I trust the people of Massachusetts to look at the facts about who I am and how I've lived my life and make their own judgment about me. But remember: @realDonaldTrump doesn't have the same kind of faith in you."
"But to do that, we’ve got to work as hard as we can between now and November 6 to tune out the lies, ignore the chaos, shrug off the fake bluster, and focus on organizing for REAL change."
"I’m ready to reverse the trillion-dollar tax scam and use that money to help cut student loan debt and rebuild infrastructure, ready to stand WITH our allies AGAINST our enemies, and get to work on clean energy, immigration reform, and gun safety."
I’m ready to support working people and help middle class families build real security. I’m ready to root out corruption and clean up Washington. I’m ready to stop the politics of hatred and division so we can bring back core American values like diversity and respect.
"Like I promised @NCAI1944 in February, whenever someone brings up my family story, I’ll use it to lift up the story of Native families and communities. I'll use it today to lift up the NIWRC and their amazing work to protect Native women from violence."
But nicknames don’t help families pay for child care. Conspiracy theories won’t solve climate change. Racial slurs can’t raise wages or make our communities safer.
"Here's the deal: @realDonaldTrump’s Washington is more corrupt & more out of touch than ever. And it turns out @realDonaldTrump never had any plan to make things better, & he has no plan now. All he can offer are attacks & distractions."
"And @realDonaldTrump should be scared – because on November 6, we’re going to bust up that con once and for all."
And you know what scares him the most? Us. The American people. He’s afraid we’ll see him for who he really is and expose the con he’s been running on our country from Day One.
"He’s afraid to stand up to Vladimir Putin in defense of our country, afraid to talk to Robert Mueller because he knows he'll crack under the pressure, and so afraid to go out in public, he hides out at his own golf clubs."
"Oh, and one more thing. @realDonaldTrump likes to pretend he’s a real tough guy. But like most bullies, he sure scares easy, doesn’t he?"
"And @realDonaldTrump loves playing the strong, decisive leader – but look at the chaos on his own staff, the way his administration fumbled the Puerto Rico recovery, or how he constantly undermines his own agenda with his own incompetence."
"He drapes himself in the flag – but for all his talk about ""Making America Great Again,"" all @realDonaldTrump does is attack our core values (the free press, the democratic process, our legacy of diversity) while he shovels taxpayer cash into his own pockets."
"He demands military parades in his honor but cheats our veterans out of charitable donations, attacks their families, ducked out of Vietnam, & can't even be bothered to visit the troops that he refuses to bring home from Afghanistan or Iraq."
"He pretends to love law enforcement – but attacks his own Justice Dept, attacks the American hero who led the FBI after 9/11 for doing his job, & stuffs his Admin with crooks who bend over backwards to make sure no CEO ever goes to jail for cheating people."
"He promised to #draintheswamp – but @realDonaldTrump is the most corrupt President in American history. The long line of scandals & convictions (Pruitt, Price, Manafort, Cohen, etc.) prove it. Art of the Deal? More like Art of the Plea Deal."

He pretends he’s a populist – but @realDonaldTrump’s economic policies are all about making the rich richer and the powerful more powerful. He’s stuffed his administration with so many former Goldman Sachs bankers they could open a branch office.
"We knew all that before @realDonaldTrump became President. But since he took office, we’ve learned that the scam runs even deeper."
"And @realDonaldTrump brags about being a successful businessman – but he’s only good at going bust (he even lost money with a casino!) and cheating people: scamming Trump U students, shortchanging workers and contractors, & abusing bankruptcy laws to save his own skin."
"For starters, @realDonaldTrump wants us to think he’s a billionaire – but he won’t show us his tax returns. Why? Maybe he isn’t as rich as he pretends, & he doesn’t want us to know that his ""empire"" is really built on debts he owes to some sketchy characters."

"Speaking of family stories, @realDonaldTrump has one, too. It's the story of a second-generation tax cheat who was handed a $413 million inheritance through rich-guy loopholes and outright criminal fraud."

Was I tough on John Kelly in that phone call? You bet I was. Apparently he thought I was an “impolite arrogant woman.” “Blah blah blah” – that’s all he had to say when he was called out for breaking the law and destroying lives.
"Before we got off the phone, I gave John Kelly something back for his troubles: a message on behalf of the American people that it was time to follow the court order and allow people stranded abroad to board planes into Logan Airport."
I asked John Kelly for an office number I could use in the future to reach him more quickly. He tried to give me the main line listed on @DHSgov’s website (really). Let’s just say I persisted longer than he did – and eventually I got his cell phone number.
"There was only 1 problem: the new @DHSgov Secretary John Kelly wouldn’t return my calls. When I finally got him on the phone, he bizarrely insisted I made the whole thing up & we’d never tried to reach him in the first place. So I read him all the emails between our staffs."

"I’m happy to be at @ClaytonState this morning with my friend @AyannaPressley to support the next governor of Georgia, @staceyabrams!"
"Next year, repealing the Affordable Care Act will be at the top of the Republicans' to-do list. That's why it's powerfully important to elect health care champions like @BetsyRaderOH on November 6. Chip in to help make it happen:   #OH14"

BTW: @sharicedavids is an INCREDIBLE Native American House candidate in Kansas – and she can win on November 6th. Donate now to help her campaign:
"Hey @realDonaldTrump, hope you’re having fun at your rally. Too bad you’re the least popular incumbent president in modern history. And in the meantime, we are coming for your pathetic rubber-stamp Republicans in Congress in 31 days."
We won't sit down. We won't shut up. November 6th is just 31 days away. Here we come.
"So please take some deep breaths – & get ready to fight back. Take your
anger with you to the voting booth. Take it with you to knock on doors, make
phone calls, & be a part of this grassroots army.

Turn your pain into power.

November 6th is just 31 days away. Here we come."
"We won’t always win when we fight. But if we don’t put up a fight, we’ll always lose."
"We called out powerful men who use their privilege to protect each other. We lifted the voices of sexual assault survivors. And we strengthened our bonds for the next fight. Because there will be a next fight, and another fight after that, and another fight after that."
"I don’t like to lose – and this one really hurts – but I’m not sorry I got in this fight. Because here’s the deal: When we fight, we get stronger. It doesn’t drain our batteries. It builds up our muscles. And this was a righteous fight."
"Today’s vote hurts people. It hurts every victim of sexual assault who’s been ignored, every woman who’s been told to be quiet, every person who’ll be on the losing end when Brett Kavanaugh casts a gut-punching deciding vote."
"Just before the vote, I thanked, hugged and consoled the hundreds of people who were still outside the Capitol and Supreme Court. Women who have relived the worst moments of their lives these past few weeks, and fought with courage for the millions who could not be here."
"Remember: Even the fights we lose matter. If we keep fighting, we can turn our anger & pain into power. So to the Republicans & @realDonaldTrump: listen up. 

32 days until Election Day. Exactly one month.

Tick, tock."
"What’s next? We can't give up. We’re owning our anger – on behalf of women told to sit down & shut up. On behalf of African Americans, Latinos, LGBTQ Americans, Native Americans, students, seniors – everyone who gets shut out of power by men who don’t know how to share."
"I’m not going to sugarcoat anything. We lost a tough fight. And it hurts. What happened today will touch every single person in this country, in some very real & terrible ways. But it’s OK to step back for a minute, take a breath, & lean on the shoulder of someone you love."
"The Senate is 1 step away from confirming Brett Kavanaugh – but we still have a chance to stop him.

"We just re-launched our online store with a whole new look & lots of new “Persist” gear. We’ve got tote bags, mugs, aprons, and much more — even pet collars!"
"We won’t go back. Not now, not ever. We must #StopKavanaugh because the lives and futures of countless American women are at stake."
"After her son, Jordan, was killed by senseless gun violence, @LucyWins2018 has been one of the most powerful voices for common-sense gun safety laws. We need Lucy in Congress, where she'll keep fighting to make our country safer. Let's help make it happen:"
"One year ago today, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. The federal response was a disgrace – these U.S. citizens still need help. I’ll keep fighting alongside @JossieValentin, & @BernieSanders and I have a debt relief plan to help Puerto Rico get back on their feet."
"Minnesotans deserve a Congressman who will show up and take on the big fights. @deanbphillips has fought for students in Minnesota, and he’s going to keep fighting for all students and families when he gets to Congress. Let's help him win in November:"
"When we fight, we can win. And with more Democratic House candidates on the ballot than any party since 1974, we've got a fighting chance at winning big in November."
"Unlike her GOP House leader opponent, @lisa4congress will fight to protect Social Security & Medicare. Keeping our promises to our seniors is the right thing to do – let’s make it clear that it’s a winning message, too. Support Lisa in WA right now:"
"Happy 71st birthday, @usairforce! I'm proud to come from an Air Force family. Two of my brothers served in the Air Force, and my oldest brother was career USAF. We are grateful every day for the work & sacrifice of our military families. #AFBDay"
"A Marine boxing champion won’t back down from a fight. @Ron_Dinicola has fought for workers, and he’ll fight to get money from powerful interests out of politics in Congress. Let’s all have his back in PA:"
Now is the time for people to make their voices heard and speak out against Kavanaugh's confirmation. Thank you to Kathleen for that great question at my town hall in Quincy.
"Plenty of Washington Republicans could use a basic civics lesson, & we’d be a lot better off if we elected a lot more teachers. @JahanaHayes, a former Ntl Teacher of the Year, would be CT’s 1st African American Democrat in Congress. Help make it happen:"
Climate change could trigger an economic crash that would put the 2008 crisis to shame. Our new Climate Risk Disclosure Act will help fight back – & @algore calls it “a critical step toward breaking our addiction to fossil fuels.”
Congrats to @LoriUSCongress & her team on their big victory in MA-3! Lori has a deep knowledge of government & strong Merrimack Valley roots. We need to elect Lori this November to have another fighter for working families in Congress. #mapoli
"Love is love & loving parents are loving parents. Period. @JoshuaWelle is a vet who respects ALL families, & he’s running against a GOP Congressman who opposes adoption for LGBT couples. Josh will be a great Rep for Central Jersey – help him win:"
"ER doc @VoteRobDavidson doesn’t take corporate PAC money, and if he wins this November, he’ll be a strong partner in the fight to #EndCorruptionNow. But he’s in a tough Michigan district – we need to fight to help put him over the top:"
"10 years after the financial crisis, Washington is working great for the big banks & their lobbyists. But what about the millions of hard-working families who lost their jobs, homes & life savings while their tax dollars bailed out Wall St CEOs? It’s not working for them."
"My heart continues to go out to cities like #Lawrence in the #MerrimackValley that continue to rebuild after last week's terrifying explosions. If you can, please make a donation to local organizations working hard to providing relief to families."
"We had a terrific 35th town hall at Quincy High School yesterday with thoughtful questions about student debt, gun violence, transgender rights, and so much more. I’m grateful to everyone who spent their Saturday talking about how to get in this fight."
Lehman Brothers collapsed 10 years ago today & set off a chain reaction that crashed our economy. Millions of Americans lost everything while Wall Street took a $700 billion bailout. We made progress with Dodd-Frank – but not enough progress.
The Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts needs help after yesterday’s gas explosions. Please donate now to these local non-profit orgs that are working hard to provide relief for families. #MVGasFire #MerrimackValley #LawrenceMA #NorthAndoverMA #AndoverMA
Thank you @BostonGas12003 and @Usw04!
"Do you hear that noise, @realDonaldTrump? Tick. Tock. We’re building a grassroots army, and in 54 days, on November 6th, we’ll sweep your Republican enablers out of office."
Katie and I spent years studying how working families go broke after a medical emergency. I know we can count on @katieporteroc to fight for health care & working families.
The Koch brothers' network just launched a HUGE new Super PAC to spend ginormous amounts of money to support GOP extremists running for office in November. We can't take anything for granted on Election Day.
"I have no words for @SteveKingIA and his white supremacist propaganda, but you should give to his opponent @Scholten4Iowa right now:"
"In 2015, @DrLeanaWen trained me to use Naloxone, the opioid overdose drug that can save lives. She’s been a strong partner of mine over the years to fight the opioid crisis & she will be an INCREDIBLE leader for @PPFA to fight for women & families. Congrats PPFA & Dr. Wen!"
Rich isn’t flashy. He’s quiet. He’s unassuming. But under that humble shell there is a fighter. And not just any kind of fighter – Rich is the kind of fighter I love. A fearless fighter.
"Speaking of strong women: The powerful interests won't pull out chairs to invite @AyannaPressley, @Abby4Iowa, @KatieHill4CA & @ShariceDavids to the table. These women are incredible — & they need our support to flip the House. Chip in & help them win:"
"Four strong women – @RosenforNevada, @kyrstensinema, @tammybaldwin & @TinaSmithMN – will help us take back the Senate in November. They need a grassroots army to fight the right-wing attacks. Today we're helping them fight back – please donate now:"
"There’s a reason why we have to fork over so much cash for prescription drugs, and it boils down to one word: Corruption. It’s time to fight back. Join me and support our new Anti-Corruption Act:   #endcorruptionnow"
Air Force veteran & House candidate @GinaOrtizJones's GOP opponent is attacking her commitment to national security credentials. Are you kidding me?! Gina fights for military families — chip in & help her flip #TX23:
Right-wing judges are itching to overturn Roe v. Wade. They were just waiting for Brett Kavanaugh to reach the Supreme Court. Speak out to #StopKavanaugh before it's too late.
I'm fighting every way I can to help Puerto Rico – from long-term housing assistance to a comprehensive debt relief plan to help the island get back on its feet. @realDonaldTrump is flat-out wrong – the people of Puerto Rico still desperately need our help.
"The @realDonaldTrump admin's response to Puerto Rico wasn't ""one of the best jobs that's ever been done"" – it was a complete failure. Trump's team couldn't even provide an accurate death count or help bury the dead."
The GOP Rep in the Florida 6th just resigned to run to governor. Let’s help @nancysoderberg — a terrific leader for health care & workers’ rights — to flip this seat. The polls are razor-thin. Chip in now to help Nancy win.

My friend @KatherineClark is a powerful voice for MA families in Washington. We need to send her back to Congress this November! #TogetherForNovember #mapoli
Brett Kavanaugh needs a lesson in basic biology. Let’s be clear: contraception is NOT abortion. We need a Supreme Court Justice who defends a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions — not someone who is pushing extremist ideology #StopKavanaugh

"A year ago today, news broke that Equifax exposed nearly 150 million Americans' sensitive information. Equifax has lied about their recklessness, made money off scandal, & weaseled out of all accountability. And I’ve fought back every step of the way."
Thank you President Obama for supporting policies in our Anti-Corruption and Accountable Capitalism Acts. The Democrats are the party of big ideas for working people – and we're fired up and ready to go fight for them.
Everything is on the line in November’s elections. And every volunteer can make a difference. Join Unity Weekend in Massachusetts & help elect Democrats up and down the ballot:

"This isn’t about politics – this is about the safety of our children, the national security of our nation, and the future of our democracy. Tell the cabinet: if Trump is unfit, invoke the 25th."
"If senior officials believe the president is unfit, they should stop hiding behind anonymous op-eds and leaking info to Bob Woodward, and do what the Constitution demands they do: invoke the 25th Amendment and remove this president from office."
Let’s be clear: We already have a constitutional crisis if the cabinet believes the President of the United States can’t do his job and then refuses to follow the rules that have been laid down in the Constitution. They can’t have it both ways.
.@realDonaldTrump shouldn’t be able to stick someone on the Supreme Court who’d have his back if he gets into serious legal trouble. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate need to defend the rule of law. #StopKavanaugh
"We won’t go back. Not now, not ever. #StopKavanaugh"

There are plenty of reasons why we need to fight to #StopKavanaugh. Let’s start with these five:
Woo-hoo! Our team kicked off the general election in a BIG way outside South Station this morning. Let's get to work supporting Massachusetts Democrats up and down the ballot. #mapoli
"Congratulations, @jay4ma & team, for winning the Massachusetts primary for governor tonight!  #mapoli"
"My friend @mikecapuano is a tireless champion for families, an advocate for working people, & above all a dedicated public servant. Mike, thank you for your decades of service to the people of Massachusetts. #mapoli"

"Less than an hour until polls close, so you still have time to cast your vote before 8 PM! Find your polling place here:  . #TeamWarrenVotes #mapoli"
There’s only a few more hours before the polls close in Massachusetts. Remember: as long as you’re in line at your polling location by 8:00 p.m. you can still vote. #TeamWarrenVotes #mapoli
Nobody is above the law. Not even the president of the United States.
"Serving as your senator is the greatest honor of my life, and I hope you’ll cast your vote today to help keep us in this fight.   #TeamWarrenVotes #mapoli"
"Woo-hoo! Today is the Massachusetts Primary. Voting is what our democracy is all about, and I hope you cast your ballot today if you haven’t already. Show me photos of your “I Voted” sticker & tag it #TeamWarrenVotes. Find your polling place here:"
"The President and his administration have launched an all-out attack on working people, but we are fighting back. Shoulder to shoulder, we’ll continue to fight for working men and women and make sure Washington works for everyone -- not just the rich and powerful."
"I'm glad to join my friends in labor at the Greater Boston Labor Council Annual Labor Day Breakfast. Unions helped build America's middle class, and unions will rebuild America's middle class."
Happy Labor Day! I'm happy to celebrate our hard-working MA workers at the Central Massachusetts AFL-CIO Labor Day Breakfast this morning -- and to fight every day to level the playing field for them.

"This makes me sick to my stomach. We need to pass gun reform laws to keep our kids safe, and invest in education to open doors for their future — not use taxpayer money to arm our teachers. @BetsyDeVosED is the worst Education Secretary ever."

Trust in government has fallen off a cliff. We need to #EndCorruptionNow to restore faith in our democracy & make our government work for the people – not just the wealthy and well-connected.

We're going to fight our hearts out for my new bill to #EndCorruptionNow. But there's something you can do right now to fight back: chip in to help @ACampaNajjar beat indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter this November.
My new anti-corruption bill would end business-as-usual in Washington – and it needs support from citizen co-signers like you. Add your name: Tell Congress to make government work for the people:   #EndCorruptionNow
We need to rip corruption out of Washington by the roots. I’ve got a new plan – the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate – to do exactly that. Join us in this fight:   #endcorruptionnow
"In Washington, money doesn't just talk — it SHOUTS. I told Seth Meyers why @RealDonaldTrump’s Administration is the most corrupt administration in our lifetime."
"I’ve said this a million times already, but I’ll say it once more: The Trump Administration is the most corrupt in modern history."
.@BetsyDeVosED’s Federal School Safety Commission isn’t making schools safer for our kids — not when the Trump administration would rather arm teachers than talk about how we stop gun violence.

Trust in government has fallen off a cliff. We need to #EndCorruptionNow to restore faith in our democracy & make our government work for the people – not just the wealthy and well-connected.
"Today on @Morning_Joe I talked about the Anti-Corruption Act. Everything that happened yesterday — Michael Cohen pleading guilty, Paul Manafort convicted on tax fraud — proves that we need to speak out and #EndCorruptionNow. Join the fight:"
"The @realDonaldTrump era has given our country its most nakedly corrupt leadership of our lifetimes. But they didn't cause the rot – they’re just the biggest, stinkiest example of it. Join the fight for my new bill to #EndCorruptionNow:"
We're going to fight our hearts out for my new bill to #EndCorruptionNow. But there's something you can do right now to fight back: chip in to help @ACampaNajjar beat indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter this November.
My new anti-corruption bill would end business-as-usual in Washington – and it needs support from citizen co-signers like you. Add your name: Tell Congress to make government work for the people:   #EndCorruptionNow
We need to rip corruption out of Washington by the roots. I’ve got a new plan – the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate – to do exactly that. Join us in this fight:   #endcorruptionnow
"In Washington, money doesn't just talk — it SHOUTS. I told Seth Meyers why @RealDonaldTrump’s Administration is the most corrupt administration in our lifetime."
"I’ve said this a million times already, but I’ll say it once more: The Trump Administration is the most corrupt in modern history."
.@BetsyDeVosED’s Federal School Safety Commission isn’t making schools safer for our kids — not when the Trump administration would rather arm teachers than talk about how we stop gun violence.
"Gary Johnson – who's supported abolishing the minimum wage, raising the Social Security retirement age, & gutting health care – jumped into the New Mexico Senate race against my friend Martin Heinrich. Help @TeamHeinrich fight back:"
"I would tell you a joke for #nationaltellajokeday, but my son Alex told me not to."
The Republicans are cherry-picking through the many documents and papers Brett Kavanaugh touched as a judge. It makes me wonder what they’re hiding.
"Aretha Franklin's music inspired so many of us to speak out and be heard, and her powerful voice will never be forgotten. Sending my best wishes to her family, friends, and fans."
"We need to realign the incentives of giant corporations so they invest in their workers, not just their shareholders. My big new bill, the Accountable Capitalism Act, helps accomplish just that."

These charts make it crystal clear: the #GOPTaxScam helps ginormous corporations & the ultra wealthy get even richer — while wages for working families are flat.
"I talked about the right to safe, legal abortion at the #RiseUpForRoe tour in Boston last night. Trump’s #SCOTUS nominee is a threat to abortion access. This is a BIG deal & we need everybody in this fight. We won’t go back — not now, not ever. #StopKavanaugh"
"This is corruption, plain and simple. @BetsyDeVosED’s latest scheme makes it even easier for shady #4profit colleges to cheat students and bury them in debt. Our kids deserve a shot at success without being scammed into massive piles of debt."

"We had a great 34th town hall (and 3rd town hall of the week) at Nauset HS in Eastham. Terrific questions about early childhood education, foreign aid, workers’ wages, prescription drug prices, and more. Thanks for spending your Saturday afternoon with us talking policy!"
"We will not forget what happened in #Charlottesville a year ago this weekend, or the victims of that ugly day in our country’s history. Racism, bigotry and hate have no place in this country. We will not compromise on this."
"We had a fired up crowd at @Fitchburg_State last night for our 33rd town hall! I’m grateful for all the terrific questions about student loans, nuclear weapons, gun violence, unions — it was a smart and thoughtful night for our democracy."
To all the reporters tweeting at me about the season premiere of @BallersHBO on Sunday night at 10pm ET like I haven't had this date saved on my calendar for months: I KNOW.

I spent decades researching why families go bankrupt. There’s a lot to chew on in this new study focusing on the struggles of seniors – and it's more evidence that we need to protect and expand Social Security.

Thousands of kids have already been ripped from their parents & there's no plan to reunite them. And @realDonaldTrump’s big solution is to create new detention camps for families. The official US policy can’t just be to throw more people in cages indefinitely.

Honor #EarthDay today by joining me & telling the Trump Admin to keep their hands off our coasts. We can’t sacrifice our shores to pad the pockets of Big Oil.
We remember the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill – one of the worst environmental disasters in human history. @realDonaldTrump has already started rescinding key safety regulations that protect our coastlines from another BP-scale disaster. #EarthDay
"Here in MA, expanded offshore drilling would threaten shipping in & out Boston, fishing from Gloucester to New Bedford, & tourism & small businesses on the Cape & Islands. This blatant giveaway to Big Oil would put MA families at risk. #EarthDay"
"It’s bad enough that @EPAScottPruitt & the Trump Admin deny the existence of climate change. They’re also threatening to make things worse, with a reckless plan to expand offshore drilling to 90% of US coastal waters. #EarthDay"
.@realDonaldTrump sold out to Big Oil & Big Coal by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement – embarrassing our country & surrendering our country’s climate leadership on the world stage. #EarthDay
On #EarthDay 2016 – exactly 2 years ago today – President @BarackObama’s Secretary of State @JohnKerry & leaders from 174 other countries signed the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was an important day for our country & our planet.
"Thank you to the 250 people who joined us on the Cape today to talk about their own struggles, and the struggles of the people they love. Fighting the opioid crisis isn't about politics - it's about saving lives."
"I’m also very grateful that experts from Parents Supporting Parents & the Duffy Health Care Center discussed the heroic work they're doing to fight the opioid crisis on the Cape. Their resources are stretched thin, & the #CAREact can help."
"MA Senator @JulianCyr & Rep @skpeake joined us to discuss what the state is doing to address the opioid epidemic. The federal govt must be a strong partner for states to provide timely, quality care to people who are desperate for it."
"This week, Rep. Elijah Cummings & I introduced the #CAREact to give state, local, & tribal govts the resources they need to fight the opioid crisis. I explained how the CARE Act could help towns like Harwich."
Today we had a thoughtful & heartbreaking conversation at Cape Cod Technical High School about the opioid crisis in Massachusetts.
"Congrats to student workers at Harvard for exercising their right to join a union! All workers, students or not, should have the chance to organize & fight for better wages & conditions. This is a powerful way to help level the playing field."
"Thank you @StonewallDemsMa! I'll always have your back, and I'm grateful you have mine. We make each other stronger!"
"My friend @AdyBarkan is a hero – not only to me, or his son Carl, but to millions of people whose health care he's fought for. I hope you'll join Ady & #beahero too."
"Happy Patriots' Day and good luck to all of our #BostonMarathon runners! No matter what Mother Nature throws at you today, #persist!"
I’ll be on @JimmyKimmelLive tonight! Tune in!
"Millions of Americans have access to basic medical care thanks to @PPFA & the amazing work of @CecileRichards. #ThankYouCecile for your leadership, your friendship, & your persistence."
Delighted to join @AFTMass in Quincy this weekend for their 50th convention. Teachers are fighting back & I’m standing with them — because a teacher’s success is a child’s success & America’s success. #aftma50
It was a BEAUTIFUL spring day in Massachusetts for an outdoor town hall in Brockton. We’re grateful so many people joined us on the steps of West Junior High School to speak out & make their voices heard.
I'll be talking with @HardballChris shortly about Mick Mulvaney & the most corrupt administration ever. Tune in!
Honor #EarthDay today by joining me & telling the Trump Admin to keep their hands off our coasts. We can’t sacrifice our shores to pad the pockets of Big Oil.
We remember the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill – one of the worst environmental disasters in human history. @realDonaldTrump has already started rescinding key safety regulations that protect our coastlines from another BP-scale disaster. #EarthDay
"Here in MA, expanded offshore drilling would threaten shipping in & out Boston, fishing from Gloucester to New Bedford, & tourism & small businesses on the Cape & Islands. This blatant giveaway to Big Oil would put MA families at risk. #EarthDay"
"It’s bad enough that @EPAScottPruitt & the Trump Admin deny the existence of climate change. They’re also threatening to make things worse, with a reckless plan to expand offshore drilling to 90% of US coastal waters. #EarthDay"
.@realDonaldTrump sold out to Big Oil & Big Coal by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement – embarrassing our country & surrendering our country’s climate leadership on the world stage. #EarthDay
On #EarthDay 2016 – exactly 2 years ago today – President @BarackObama’s Secretary of State @JohnKerry & leaders from 174 other countries signed the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was an important day for our country & our planet.
"Thank you to the 250 people who joined us on the Cape today to talk about their own struggles, and the struggles of the people they love. Fighting the opioid crisis isn't about politics - it's about saving lives."
"I’m also very grateful that experts from Parents Supporting Parents & the Duffy Health Care Center discussed the heroic work they're doing to fight the opioid crisis on the Cape. Their resources are stretched thin, & the #CAREact can help."

Early voting for the May 8th Ohio primary started this week. I hope you’ll fight for @RichCordray because he’s always fought for us. Sign up to learn more & volunteer:
"This afternoon we had a GREAT rally in Columbus with @RichCordray & @BettySutton, where I let everyone know: Rich will be a fearless fighter for the people of Ohio."
"This morning I joined @RichCordray in Cincinnati for a discussion about the opioid epidemic. We talked Rich's plan to protect Medicaid expansion, & my new bill to help states like Ohio with federal funds for locally controlled programs."
"Just got back to Boston after a terrific day in Ohio with my good friend & Ohio's next governor, @RichCordray!"
Glad to join @KatherineClark at an amazing #TownHallForOurLives organized by MA students in Natick. I'm proud to be in this fight with them to stop gun violence in our schools and on our streets.
"Our local @DotNews hosted a TERRIFIC town hall at @BTU66 tonight. We talked about housing, the opioid epidemic, the T, war & peace, & even my coffee preferences. Thanks to everyone who joined us to share their thoughts & concerns & be a part of this fight."
"It is up to us to answer Dr. King’s charge to make the American Dream a reality, to make real the promises of democracy. Not just for wealthy & the powerful, but for all people, for the least of these. #MLK50"
"We will say, loud and clear, that #blacklivesmatter. And when a racist bully uses hateful rhetoric to divide our country & push discrimination in America, you better believe we will fight back. #MLK50"
We will fight to end voter suppression. Fight for working families & economic justice. Fight to end the epidemic of mass incarceration. Fight to protect Dreamers & those with temporary protected status. #MLK50

So they sat-in where they were told they didn’t belong. They stood up when they were told they should cower. They marched where they were told they could not go. They rode. Voted. Ran for office. Spoke out. They lifted their voices until the entire nation heard them. #MLK50
Dr. King & countless other unsung heroes of the movement were engaged in an all out fight to create an America that lived up to its ideals. An America that fought for the least of these. #MLK50
"Teachers in OK, KY, WV, & all across the country change the lives of little girls and boys every day. They deserve our respect & support. I stand in solidarity with those teachers who are fighting to support their families & invest in their students. Their fight is our fight."
Things look very different now. Many teachers work 2 or 3 jobs before & after school & weekends to make ends meet. They struggle to teach while their school’s funding plummets year after year. They use their own money to buy basic school supplies or help out their students.
"There were a lot of bumps along the way, but I never gave up my dream of becoming a teacher. I’m the daughter of a maintenance man who became a teacher, a professor, & a US Senator because America invested in kids like me & in great teachers like Mrs. Lee."
"One day Mrs. Lee took me aside to explain that if I worked hard, I could become a teacher, too – and it changed my whole world. No one in my family had graduated from college. But when Mrs. Lee said, “Yes, Miss Betsy, you can,” I saw myself in a different way."
"I loved my 2nd grade teacher. From the 1st day I walked into Mrs. Lee’s classroom at Wilson Elementary School in Norman, Oklahoma, I knew she was special. She gave the best hugs ever. Like great teachers everywhere, she opened up new possibilities for every one of her students."
This is what democracy looks like. #MarchForOurLives

These are the faces of the people in Worcester and all across the country who are fighting back and demanding change. I love it. #MarchForOurLives
Surprise stop in Worcester to thank our student #MarchForOurLives organizers!
On our way to Western MA for more #MarchforOurLives events!
Glad to see so many students taking to the streets in Boston this morning to make their voices heard. #MarchforOurLives
Change is coming — in Boston and all across this country. #MarchforOurLives
I’m honored to fight alongside these students in Boston to stop gun violence in our schools. #MarchForOurLives
Meeting with some of the students who helped organize today’s #MarchForOurLives in Boston. They’re demanding action — and today is about listening to them.
No amount of pressure on the industry can substitute action by Congress – and I’m going to keep fighting until we pass common sense gun reform. But every change is important. Engaging investors is one way we can start. #YouFundGuns
Today we launched #YouFundGuns – an easy website to help you call or tweet at the country’s biggest investment firms. Urge them to use their leverage as shareholders in gun companies to help reduce gun violence.
"Shareholders hold the reins in any public company. Money talks. But for the most part, the investment firms haven’t had the political courage to step up and lead this fight to stop gun violence. #YouFundGuns"
"Last month, I sent letters to 9 of the country’s biggest investment firms – all major shareholders in gun companies. I asked them to use their financial muscle to push for more responsible behavior by gun manufacturers. #YouFundGuns"
We can’t wait for the @NRA to give Congress permission to do something about gun violence in America. This is an emergency. We must find other ways to keep our kids safe. #YouFundGuns
"Every St. Patrick's Day, South Boston brings us together for a breakfast full of great company and not-so-great jokes. Thanks to the Ironworkers Local 7 for hosting all of us this year!"
These kids inspire me. And they're right: enough is enough. #NationalWalkoutDay
"This week, the Senate will hold their final vote on a bill that will roll back reform for big Wall Street banks. Watch as I explained to people in Springfield why the #BankLobyistAct is awful for people in Massachusetts and across this country."
"If you can’t be in NY today, share your story with the @NewYorkFed about how the 2008 crash impacted your life. #10YearsAfter, we can’t let them forget."
"If you’re going to be in NY today, join @CPDAction at 1pm to let the @NewYorkFed know that we remember what happened ten years ago – and we can’t let it happen again."
"Right now, the @NewYorkFed President is being replaced. It's one of the most important economic jobs in America that @realDonaldTrump doesn’t control. We need someone in the job who will work for the American people, not for Wall Street. #10YearsAfter"

"10 years ago this week, Bear Stearns was the 1st financial giant to collapse. The @NewYorkFed rescued Bear Stearns by negotiating its sale to @JPMorgan – but it was too late to stop the worst crash since the Great Depression. #10YearsAfter"
"But @realDonaldTrump is right - I am angry, and so are a lot of Americans. Angry because his corrupt cronies control the levers of government to help their billionaire buddies. Angry because DC kicks dirt in the teeth of working people time and time again. We've had enough of it."
"The majority of violent crimes experienced by Native Americans are perpetrated by non-Natives, and more than half of Native women have experienced sexual violence. I wish @realDonaldTrump and his Admin would focus on that rather than making Native people the butt of a joke."
I can't force @realDonaldTrump to respect Native Americans. Or to read his intelligence briefings. Or to take seriously threats to our security. Or to stop defending domestic abusers and white supremacists. Or to stop sucking up to Wall Street and sticking it to workers.
We had a terrific 22nd town hall at Weymouth HS! The conversation ranged from issues personal to the South Shore — like the Weymouth compressor station & Scituate sea walls — to health care & North Korea. I’m very grateful for everyone who came out to make their voices heard.
"We had a terrific day at @S_T_C_C for our open house. We had good discussions about net neutrality, Puerto Rico, voting rights, Wall St, health care, & how to be in this fight — not just every 4 years, but every day. Thanks to the 350 people who joined us for a fun afternoon!"
"I want a Democratic Party strong enough to compete for every vote, in every race, at every level, in every state, in every election – and I’m willing to do my part to help make that happen. #IWillVote"
"I believe in the work @TheDemocrats & Democratic state parties do to elect leaders who will fight to level the playing field. So as of today, I’ve sent $5k donations to every single one of our 50 state parties to help them hire organizers & register voters. #IWillVote"
"Earlier today, the Senate held its 1st floor vote on the #BankLobbyistAct, and the results weren't pretty. If the @SenateGOP & some @SenateDems are going to help the bank lobbyists roll back Wall Street reform, we’re going to make sure the American people know about it."
"We had a fantastic town hall at Wachusett Regional High School this morning. Thank you to everyone who braved the rain, came out and shared their story. Your voices keep me in this fight!"
"I’m going to fight the @NRA at every turn until we have sensible gun policies that keep our country safe. If Wayne LaPierre thinks we’re terrifying, he ain’t seen nothing yet. Chip in now to show the NRA we’re fighting back."
Wayne LaPierre can call me whatever he wants. He doesn’t scare me. You know what scares Wayne LaPierre? That people will lift their voices & demand action. That his name-calling & bullying won’t work anymore.
We won’t stop fighting to ban assault weapons. We won’t stop fighting for background checks. We’re going to fight so kids can to go to school without worrying they might get shot & killed in their classroom.
"The @NRA has been working round the clock since Parkland to stop common-sense gun reform. Including, it seems, bullying those of us who side with students over gun lobbyists. It’s disgusting, but it’s not going to shut us up."
I don’t want the support of a radical extremist who puts the profits of the gun industry before the safety of our children in Massachusetts & across the country.
Wayne LaPierre – the head of the @NRA – gave a big speech today & made it clear that he isn’t a fan of mine. And you know what? That’s perfectly fine by me. The feeling is mutual.
"Kids like Allie give me hope. They’re smart, passionate and unafraid to ask big questions. Thanks for the great question, Allie. Keep holding signs, knocking on doors and speaking up. We’re ready to hear your voice."

"And today I made a promise to @NCAI1944 tribal leaders: Every time someone brings up my family’s story, I’m going to use it to lift up the story of their families & communities. Read my full remarks here.   #ECWS2018"
"I also told the story of my parents, because they were real people too. The love they shared, the struggles they endured, the family they built, & the story they lived will always be a part of me. No one – not even the President – will ever take that part of me away. #ECWS2018"
"I’ve noticed that when my name comes up, @realDonaldTrump likes to talk about Pocahontas. So I figured, let’s talk about Pocahontas. Not the tale that's been twisted for centuries – but the real Pocahontas, and her story of heroism. And bravery. And pain. @NCAI1944 #ECWS2018"
I was honored to speak this morning at the National Congress of American Indians’ Executive Council Winter Session & Tribal Nations Policy Summit. @NCAI1944 #ECWS2018
I call dibs on holding @tammyduckworth's baby while she's voting – and fighting to change the Senate's dumb rules so I don't have to.
"It's official: My friend @JeffMerkley is a rock star in Massachusetts. Thanks for coming by our Franklin town hall, and thanks for leading our fight for working families!"
"We had an INCREDIBLE town hall in Franklin, MA today. The energy & passion of the 1100 people who joined us at @FranklinHS fills me with hope & keeps us in this fight. Thank you!"
"The world changed on the day of the Women’s March 2017. But even after all that, I never imagined what would happen a few weeks later, on 2/7. That was the day @SenateMajLdr tried to silence me – and silence Coretta Scott King – on the floor of the Senate. #ShePersisted"
I'm using every tool in the toolbox to fight for working families in Massachusetts and across this country.
"Sorry, everyone: New England is #notdone. Let's go @Patriots! #superbowl #GoPats"
"If you’re angry, frustrated, or worried after the #SOTU – and you want something to do about it other than throwing your TV out the window – chip in right now and join our team to fight back."
"The character of our country – and the state of our union – isn’t determined by our President. It’s determined by our people. Now more than ever, we’re in this fight all the way. #SOTU"
"America isn’t prouder when @realDonaldTrump embraces bigotry, hatred & fear – & calls that patriotism. #SOTU"
America’s economy isn’t safer when @realDonaldTrump rolls back the rules on Wall Street to let the big banks gamble with our economy again. #SOTU
"America isn’t safer when @realDonaldTrump alienates our allies, plays a stupid, reckless game of chicken with a dangerous foreign power, & threatens nuclear war. #SOTU"
"America’s moral fabric isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump breaks our promise to 800,000 Dreamers. #SOTU"
"America’s future isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump gives away gigantic tax breaks to billionaires & giant corporations so there’s no money for education, infrastructure, & the tools we need to succeed."
Let’s be clear: America isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump tries to rip health care away from millions of Americans. #SOTU
"I went to the #SOTU. I wanted it burned into my eyes. If there’s ever a moment when I’m too tired to keep fighting, I just have to close my eyes & see @realDonaldTrump , @mike_pence & @pryan applauding themselves for punching working families in the gut, & I'm back in this fight."

"I’ve noticed that when my name comes up, @realDonaldTrump likes to talk about Pocahontas. So I figured, let’s talk about Pocahontas. Not the tale that's been twisted for centuries – but the real Pocahontas, and her story of heroism. And bravery. And pain. @NCAI1944 #ECWS2018"
I was honored to speak this morning at the National Congress of American Indians’ Executive Council Winter Session & Tribal Nations Policy Summit. @NCAI1944 #ECWS2018
I call dibs on holding @tammyduckworth's baby while she's voting – and fighting to change the Senate's dumb rules so I don't have to.
"It's official: My friend @JeffMerkley is a rock star in Massachusetts. Thanks for coming by our Franklin town hall, and thanks for leading our fight for working families!"
"We had an INCREDIBLE town hall in Franklin, MA today. The energy & passion of the 1100 people who joined us at @FranklinHS fills me with hope & keeps us in this fight. Thank you!"
"The world changed on the day of the Women’s March 2017. But even after all that, I never imagined what would happen a few weeks later, on 2/7. That was the day @SenateMajLdr tried to silence me – and silence Coretta Scott King – on the floor of the Senate. #ShePersisted"
I'm using every tool in the toolbox to fight for working families in Massachusetts and across this country.
"Sorry, everyone: New England is #notdone. Let's go @Patriots! #superbowl #GoPats"
"If you’re angry, frustrated, or worried after the #SOTU – and you want something to do about it other than throwing your TV out the window – chip in right now and join our team to fight back."
"The character of our country – and the state of our union – isn’t determined by our President. It’s determined by our people. Now more than ever, we’re in this fight all the way. #SOTU"
"America isn’t prouder when @realDonaldTrump embraces bigotry, hatred & fear – & calls that patriotism. #SOTU"
America’s economy isn’t safer when @realDonaldTrump rolls back the rules on Wall Street to let the big banks gamble with our economy again. #SOTU
"America isn’t safer when @realDonaldTrump alienates our allies, plays a stupid, reckless game of chicken with a dangerous foreign power, & threatens nuclear war. #SOTU"
"America’s moral fabric isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump breaks our promise to 800,000 Dreamers. #SOTU"
"America’s future isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump gives away gigantic tax breaks to billionaires & giant corporations so there’s no money for education, infrastructure, & the tools we need to succeed."
Let’s be clear: America isn’t stronger when @realDonaldTrump tries to rip health care away from millions of Americans. #SOTU
"I went to the #SOTU. I wanted it burned into my eyes. If there’s ever a moment when I’m too tired to keep fighting, I just have to close my eyes & see @realDonaldTrump , @mike_pence & @pryan applauding themselves for punching working families in the gut, & I'm back in this fight."
Malden High School is one of the most diverse schools in Massachusetts - and it was the perfect setting for the thoughtful and wide-ranging conversation we had at our 18th town hall today. Thank you all for making your voices heard!
Go @UMassAmherst! It was a treat to see our very own @UMassBand march in the Rose Parade today. You were amazing (as always) & made MA proud! #UMassRoses
"If you can, please pitch in $5 – or whatever you can afford – before our 2017 fundraising deadline at midnight tonight. Don’t wait until 2018 to be ready for the big fights ahead."
We have a battle coming in Massachusetts in 2018. Billionaire Breitbart donor Robert Mercer started funding nasty attack ads against me months ago. @realDonaldTrump is tweeting his socks off to beat us next November. I’m not taking anything for granted.
I’m going to say something really crazy: I believe in science. Climate change is real and we have a moral obligation to protect this Earth for our children and grandchildren.

"Today’s town hall in Gloucester was our 17th town hall of 2017. All across the Commonwealth, we’re in this fight together."
We had another incredible crowd at Gloucester High School this morning for our last town hall of 2017. I’m deeply grateful for the thousands of people all across MA who have attended our events to speak out & make your voices heard. We make each other stronger.
I call on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to listen to the people of Alabama and seat @GDouglasJones without any delay.
We can’t stop now. The 2018 elections are less than a year away. We must invest in campaigns across the country. We must take a stand against the hateful ideologies that have been making their way back into our country’s highest offices. And we must fight harder than ever before.
"If we take away 1 more lesson from Alabama, it’s this: Dems can win in every district & state across the country. So we need to fight harder than ever to recruit, support, & elect candidates & compete in every election."
"Tonight Alabama is sending a powerful message across the country. The American people will fight back against bigotry, hate &, yes, pedophilia – & reject a man totally unfit to serve in the US Senate. Republican, Democrat, Independent – on this, there will be no compromise."
We elected a Democrat in deep red Alabama tonight. Why? Because @GDouglasJones was a great candidate. We had the right message. We had the wind in our sails. And we fought our hearts out.
"The Trump Administration is on a mission to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We can whimper, we can whine, or we can fight back. #CFPB"
It’s just not okay. No person should fear losing their life for their gender identity or expression in the US in 2017. Today we remember – but we also fight back for trans rights & protections here & around the world. #TDOR

"I've reintroduced my Tax Filing Simplification Act to direct the IRS develop a free, online tax prep system. #TaxDay"
"In 1998, a GOP Congress passed an IRS reform bill with a return-free system. But IRS handed over tax filing to private companies. #TaxDay"
"If ever there was a time to fight, this is it. That’s why I wrote my new book, This Fight is Our Fight, out today."
Washington works great for those who can hire an army of lawyers and lobbyists. People are angry – and they’re right to be angry.
America used to be a country that invested in opportunity for everyone – but now America’s middle class is on the ropes.
"Making our voices heard is what democracy is all about. If we fight, we have a fighting chance to send Jon @Ossoff to Congress. #FlipThe6th"
"Already voted for @Ossoff to #Flipthe6th? There’s no harm in double-checking that your family, friends, neighbors voted too."
.@realDonaldTrump & the GOP are in a panic that GA could pick a Rep who fights for working people – not the rich & powerful. #Flipthe6th
"Happy Election Day, GA-6! If you haven’t already, I hope you’ll go cast your vote for Jon @Ossoff to #FlipThe6th."
Good morning! In just a few minutes I'll be talking with @MLauer & @SavannahGuthrie on the @TODAYshow. Tune in!
"Happy Patriots' Day, Massachusetts – and good luck to all our #BostonMarathon runners today!"
"We want to know who you’re really working for, @realDonaldTrump. It’s time to release your taxes."
I know this might be a controversial statement for the Republican leadership... but I believe in science. #MarchforScience
"Thank you for your terrific service, Dr. @vivek_murthy. We hope to see you back in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts soon."
"Golden parachutes are wrong for predators on Wall Street, & they're wrong for predators at Fox News."

I’m deeply grateful that you’re a part of this fight. We’re just getting started.
That map shows something powerfully important: a strong grassroots movement is ready to fight back & make real change for MA & our country.
"In the first three months of 2017, almost 16,000 people from every corner of Massachusetts chipped in to support our campaign. #mapoli"

Money in politics is a problem. The People's Pledge is a step in the right direction. I hope we'll have one in 2018.
"In 2012, Scott Brown & I signed a People's Pledge to keep outside groups from dumping money into Massachusetts, & it worked."
"When the Republicans say they want to repeal health care for 24 million people today, they need to explain this."
I joined @NARAL & @peoples_defense on the SCOTUS steps this morning to kick off delivery of 1M petitions opposing Judge Gorsuch. #WeObject
"Judge Gorsuch has a long, detailed record that shows he cares more about corporations than women, workers, consumers, & families. #WeObject"
"When Justice Scalia died, giant corporations & their right-wing buddies spent millions to keep the SCOTUS seat open for @realDonaldTrump."
"Today I stand in solidarity with “A Day Without Immigrants” protesters. #ImmigrantsFeedAmerica, & immigrants make our country strong."
Let's go Pats! #OneMore
The excuses end now. Today I spoke to @USProgressives & said: It's time for Dems to grow a backbone & fight.
"Our country is in crisis because for years, Washington has worked great for the rich & powerful, but it hasn't worked for anyone else."
Our country is in crisis – but that crisis didn't begin with the election of @realDonaldTrump.
Woo-hoo! Let's go Pats!   #Patriots

"Had a fantastic rally in Philadelphia today for @KatieMcGintyPA, our next senator from PA!"
About to take the stage for @KatieMcGintyPA & @HillaryClinton in Philly. Watch live!
Terrific morning at the Worcester & Boston Labor Day breakfasts! Unions built & will rebuild America's middle class.
One of the best glass galleries in the world is in Stockbridge at the @SchantzGallery. Breathtaking beauty.
Elm Street Market in Stockbridge has great milkshakes AND a terrific hot roast beef sandwich - local delicacies!
Visited last night with cast & crew of Ugly Lies the Bone - a powerful play about an amazing woman - at @shakeandco.
A trip to Western MA wouldn't be complete without a stop for a beer at Old Forge in Lanesboro!
"Wow, what an amazing crowd at @BerkshireCC today to talk about working families!"
Treasures in Western MA last night at @JacobsPillow. The dancers were amazing - & the crew brought it all home.
We had a terrific talk in Roxbury tonight about leveling the playing for working families!
"Whether under this President or the next, the @GOP needs to get the message: stop holding small lenders hostage to Wall Street giveaways."
"For months, Ds called for help for small lenders & servicemembers. @GOP kept blocking unless we also weakened rules on giant Wall St banks."
Glad @HillaryClinton supports targeted relief for small lenders & helping the @CFPB protect servicemembers.
".@abbey_dags may have a torn ACL, but she also has a heart of gold. Couldn't be prouder that she's from MA! #rio2016"

".@Judo_Kayla proves that the toughest fighters come from MA. We're so proud of you, Kayla! #USA #Rio2016"
Wow! All of MA felt like @Aly_Raisman's mom watching that @USAGym finale. Congrats Aly! (And congrats @Simone_Biles!) #USA #FinalFive
Join Dems in calling on @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr to bring back Congress to pass a clean #Zika bill:
"Every day the GOP stalls funding #Zika response, more people get sick. More babies risk being born with heartbreaking head deformities."
"When a reporter asked @SenateMajLdr why he wouldn’t pass a clean #Zika bill, he said that’s just the way things are done in Washington."
"I didn’t think the @HouseGOP could pass 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, @PPFA & clean water all at once, but their #Zika bill did it."
"The last @HouseGOP #Zika bill – jammed thru at 3am during #nobillnobreak – was a pathetic, dishonest, malicious bill loaded w/ poison pills."
"#Zika is a public health emergency, but the @HouseGOP & @SenateGOP have no plans to do anything before Labor Day."
Woo-hoo! Congrats to Needham's own @Aly_Raisman & the entire @USAGym women's team! We're so proud of you! #USA #Rio2016
"Your reckless comments sound like a two-bit dictator, @realDonaldTrump. Not a man who wants to lead the greatest democracy on the planet."
.@realDonaldTrump makes death threats because he's a pathetic coward who can’t handle the fact that he’s losing to a girl.
"The American people aren’t dumb, @realDonaldTrump. We don’t trust you with our nuclear codes AND we don’t trust you with our economy."
.@realDonaldTrump's economics plan is all about helping rich guys like Donald Trump get richer – & leaving everyone else behind.
Even @realDonaldTrump's childcare plan gives billionaires w/ a nanny a tax break while millions of low-income households get nothing.
"And taxes? @realDonaldTrump wants billionaires & giant corps to pay EVEN LESS – so there’s less money for ed, infrastructure & research."
"Cheating customers & gaming the system might be your business, @realDonaldTrump, but it’s not the way America is going to do business."
"For months, Ds called for help for small lenders & servicemembers. @GOP kept blocking unless we also weakened rules on giant Wall St banks."

Trump gets advice from Bear Stearns' fmr chief economist. So @realDonaldTrump: did BS need FEWER regs when they helped crash our economy?
"W/o rules, @realDonaldTrump, too many huge banks juiced profits by cheating ppl on mortgages, credit cards, etc, then crashed our economy."
"A “moratorium” on agency regulations means stopping new rules on shady payday lenders & too-big-to-fail banks, @realDonaldTrump."
"“Cut regulations massively,” @realDonaldTrump? No rules & no accountability means people get ripped off & markets blow up. Remember 2008?"
.@realDonaldTrump's econ plan was written by rich corporate insider advisors to make the economy even greater for rich corporate insiders.
We had a great talk about working families in New Bedford tonight. Thanks to everyone who joined us!
Thanks to the hundreds of people who joined us in Worcester to talk about building a future for working families!

.@realDonaldTrump? He cheered on the 2008 housing crisis so he could scoop up real estate on the cheap. Trump thinks only about himself.
.@timkaine started his career helping families fight housing discrimination. That’s because Tim has always had a good heart.

The @CFPB has forced the big banks to return $11.7B directly to people who have been cheated. That's gov that works for the people!
"The financial industry HATED the @CFPB, but we fought back & won. Today we celebrate the 5-yr anniv of that little agency opening its doors."
"One thing we definitely got right in Dodd-Frank was the @CFPB. Wall St can't cheat people on mortgages, credit cards & student loans."
Dodd-Frank wasn’t perfect – we still have more work to do to make sure the big banks don’t bring down our economy again.
"6 yrs ago today, @BarackObama signed Dodd-Frank, the Wall St reform bill that was a powerful step towards holding the big banks accountable."
Want to know what I think of Trump's speech tonight? Stay up for @colbertlateshow to find out. #colbertRNC #lssc
.@realDonaldTrump models himself on an insecure narcissist whose lies & schemes embarrassed our country. Figures.

Terrifying to think of @mike_pence being a heartbeat from presidency – but the direction @GOP wants to take our country is MORE terrifying.
The @GOP platform even says that children not from “natural marriage” are more likely to be drug addicts. Hateful AND disgusting.
The @GOP platform says overturn marriage equality & it supports parents putting their LGBT children through conversion therapy. Disgusting.
And OF COURSE @realDonaldTrump – a guy who “[doesn’t] feel good” about marriage equality – picked a VP famous for LGBT discrimination.
"The @GOP platform is the most anti-choice ever: defund @PPFA & denounce all abortion. Even cases of rape, incest & woman's potential death."
What's worse? @realDonaldTrump & @mike_pence’s sexism isn’t some radical fringe of the @GOP. They're in line with the party platform.
Of COURSE @realDonaldTrump – a guy who calls women fat pigs & bimbos – picked a VP who is famous for trying to control women’s bodies.

Tonight I called out @realDonaldTrump in not-so-subtle terms. Watch this.
".@RealDonaldTrump trolls for votes & wants working ppl to believe he's for them. News flash, Donald: working ppl are smarter than you think."
.@realDonaldTrump made clear he would abolish the federal minimum wage. One of a million reasons why working ppl can't make him the boss.
.@realDonaldTrump got destroyed on his min wage position. I was right when I called him out.
"I worked with @KamalaHarris -- she's tough, principled & fearless. Happy to support her campaign!"
".@realDonaldTrump can’t talk about Wall St, college costs or min wage, so he spent all day belching insults. Pathetic. Really pathetic."
.@realDonaldTrump: Your policies are dangerous. Your words are reckless. Your record is embarrassing. And your free ride is over.
"When asked what gov should stop doing, @realDonaldTrump said overseeing banks! How can you be tough on Wall Street by letting them off?"
"You're so concerned about Wall Street, @realDonaldTrump, that you say you’d “absolutely” repeal Dodd-Frank?"
"You feel so much for people with college debt, @realDonaldTrump, that you raked in millions scamming students with Trump University?"
"You care so much about struggling American workers, @realDonaldTrump, that you want to abolish the federal minimum wage?"
"Do you think you're going to shut us up, @realDonaldTrump? Think again. It's time to answer for your dangerous ideas."
"We get it, @realDonaldTrump: When a woman stands up to you, you’re going to call her a basket case. Hormonal. Ugly."
"No, @realDonaldTrump - your racism, sexism & xenophobia doesn't drive me nuts. It makes me sick. And I'm not alone."
"Whatever @realDonaldTrump says, we won't shut up. We won't back down. This election is too important, & he won’t step foot in White House."
.@realDonaldTrump lied his way through the primaries without being held accountable. That’s over.
"The @GOP's hate-filled lies didn’t scare me before, @realDonaldTrump. And they don't scare me now."
"If you think recycling Scott Brown's hate-filled attacks on my family is going to shut me up, @realDonaldTrump, think again buddy. Weak."
"But here's the thing. You can beat a bully -- not by tucking tail and running, but by holding your ground."
"Watch this video, @realDonaldTrump. Explain why you root for working people to fail."
Tonight I called out @realDonaldTrump in not-so-subtle terms. Watch this.
".@RealDonaldTrump trolls for votes & wants working ppl to believe he's for them. News flash, Donald: working ppl are smarter than you think."
.@realDonaldTrump made clear he would abolish the federal minimum wage. One of a million reasons why working ppl can't make him the boss.
.@realDonaldTrump got destroyed on his min wage position. I was right when I called him out.
"I worked with @KamalaHarris -- she's tough, principled & fearless. Happy to support her campaign!"
".@realDonaldTrump can’t talk about Wall St, college costs or min wage, so he spent all day belching insults. Pathetic. Really pathetic."
.@realDonaldTrump: Your policies are dangerous. Your words are reckless. Your record is embarrassing. And your free ride is over.
"When asked what gov should stop doing, @realDonaldTrump said overseeing banks! How can you be tough on Wall Street by letting them off?"

.@realDonaldTrump spews insults and lies because he can’t have an honest conversation about his dangerous vision for America.
.@realdonaldtrump is a bully who has a single play in his playbook -- offensive lies thrown at anyone who calls him out.
We saw when Scott Brown attacked my family & his staff made tomahawk chops & war whoops. They lost big. MA voters knew better.
We saw what happened when birthers like @realDonaldTrump attacked @BarackObama. They lost big. American voters knew better.
"“Goofy,” @realDonaldTrump? For a guy with ""the best words"" that’s a pretty lame nickname. Weak!"
"I called out @realDonaldTrump on Tuesday. 45 million saw it. He's so confident about his ""counter punch"" he waited until Friday night. Lame."
I'm going to fight my heart out to make sure @realDonaldTrump’s toxic stew of hatred & insecurity never reaches the White House.
It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man's narcissism and divisiveness.
"What happens next will test the character for all of us – Republican, Democrat, and Independent."
"And @realDonaldTrump puts out out contradictory & nonsensical national security ideas one expert called ""incoherent"" & ""truly bizarre."""
surrounds himself w/ foreign policy advisors who've been called a “collection of charlatans.”
.@realDonaldTrump attacks vets like @SenJohnMcCain who were captured & puts our servicemembers at risk by cheerleading illegal torture.
".@realDonaldTrump incites supporters to violence, praises Putin, and is ""cool with being called an authoritarian."""
There's more enthusiasm for @realDonaldTrump among leaders of the KKK than leaders of the political party he now controls.
"Here’s what else is real: @realDonaldTrump has built his campaign on racism, sexism, and xenophobia."
.@realDonaldTrump is now the leader of the @GOP. It's real - he is one step away from the White House.
We need @TammyforIL in the Senate - & a Democratic majority - to fight for working families in IL & across the country. #standwithTammy
"Glad to join @TammyforIL in Chicago to discuss how she'll fight for seniors, vets & disabled Americans in the Sen!"
"Hey @TedCruz: Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your ""significant sacrifices"" - & more time doing something about theirs."
"You chose to run for President, @TedCruz. You chose to make your “sacrifices.” Working people don't have a choice."

"And @TedCruz? Working people work more, get paid less, can't save, get mistreated, struggle with illness & family - but they don't whine."
"Know who’s facing ""constant attacks,"" @TedCruz? Hardworking American immigrants, Muslims, LGBT folks, women. Your constant attacks."
"Know who gets no family time, @TedCruz? Moms w/ unfair schedules who drop kids at daycare & find their hrs cancelled. @GOP won't help."
Know who gets no personal time? People who work 2 min wage jobs to support their families. @TedCruz opposes giving them a raise.
Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who stay up worrying about getting kids thru college w/o big debt. @TedCruz blocked #refi.
Know whose health is limited? Workers w/ no paid leave who can't stay home when sick or caring for kids. @TedCruz won't support it.
"Are you kidding me, @TedCruz? We’re supposed to pity you because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?! 2 words: Boo hoo."
".@TedCruz whined about facing constant attacks, nonexistent family time, limited health and sleep, and no personal time."
Yesterday @TedCruz sent a campaign email whining about the “significant sacrifice” he’s made to run for President.

We need to level the playing field and end too big to fail.

But the 2016 Republicans claim they'll repeal all the new financial regulations – hoping to be chosen as Wall Street's favorite candidate.
"11 big banks are still so risky that if any one started to fail, they'd need a gov bailout or risk taking down the economy – again."

.@HillaryClinton is right to fight GOP efforts to sneak financial reform rollbacks into the funding bill.
So here's my message to Wall Street & their GOP buddies: we're ready to fight back to protect the @CFPB. #GOPDebate
"Wall Street knows if they soften @CFPB support, the GOP will feel better undercutting the agency in closed-door deals. #GOPDebate"
Thousands of dollars on a TV ad is nothing compared to the money the big banks save if their GOP buddies go after the @CFPB. #GOPDebate
"The @CFPB has forced the big financial companies to return more than $11B to people they cheated on credit cards, mortgages, etc. #GOPDebate"
"Wall Street has a problem: They know the @CFPB is working, & it's incredibly popular with the families it helps. #GOPDebate"

I’m not going to stop talking about Citigroup’s unprecedented grasp on our government’s economic policymaking apparatus.
The biggest Wall Street banks want a Washington that works only for them. Well they can forget it.
"Join a @Public_Citizen webinar @ 7 pm ET about ISDS, the dangerous provision hidden in TPP:   #ISDSCorporateAttacks"
Wall St's 2014 BONUSES were 2x the income of all full-time min wage workers. That's obscene.

Let's finish the job. Go Pats!
The GOP isn't even trying to pretend that they aren't bought & paid for by the Koch brothers anymore.
I've announced a new bill to make big drug companies that break the law put more money into funding medical research:
"Good to see Mitt Romney suddenly talking about working families. Are corporations still people too, Mitt?"
I worked with @KamalaHarris when she stood up to the banks & fought for CA homeowners. Happy to support her campaign:
"Thanks @devalpatrick for leaving MA stronger for all of us. I'm proud to call you my governor, partner & friend."
No one spoke more powerfully about America's middle class than Gov. Mario Cuomo. We'll miss his voice & his heart.

Banks should not be able to make secret deals with schools to market debit cards to students. We need transparency.
Glad AG Holder is in #Ferguson for independent federal investigation of Michael Brown's death. We need straight answers about what happened.
Thank you @barackobama for fighting for students & supporting the #BankonStudents Act:
America's mayors report: We must do more to give every kid a fighting chance to succeed.
"This is America, not a war zone. The people of #Ferguson just want answers. We all want answers."
"Last week, federal regulators acknowledged that all of the biggest banks remain Too Big to Fail:"
Credit reports are often wrong. My Equal Employment for All Act stops companies from using them on job applicants.
Were these $128 billion settlements a good deal for our country? That's why I introduced the Truth in Settlements Act

You should be able to support a family if you work a full time job. The GOP is just wrong to block the minimum wage increase. #raisethewage
Our regulators already have all the tools they need to protect a free and open Internet. They should stand up and use them.
Reports that the FCC may gut net neutrality are disturbing & would be one more way the playing field is tilted for the rich & powerful.
"We don’t know who is going to have the next big idea in this country, but we’re pretty sure they’re going to need to get online to do it."

"If you don't want anyone to talk about your votes, Senator Brown, you shouldn't have voted that way. #masen #mapoli"
We can do a lot more than talk about Scott Brown's voting record - we can hold him accountable for it on Election Day. #masen #mapoli

Scott Brown voted against the Buffett Rule. I'm going to keep talking about that. #masen #mapoli

"Scott Brown supports the Blunt amendment, opposes equal pay, endorses Paul Ryan & works for a GOP majority in the Senate. #masen #mapoli"
The Republican agenda is to select a VP nominee who co-sponsored legislation with Rep Akin to redefine “rape.” #masen #mapoli
The Republican agenda is to cut funding for Planned Parenthood. #masen #mapoli
The Republican agenda is to deny women equal pay for equal work. #masen #mapoli
