"Time and time again, President Trump has refused to stand up to Putin. His silence on the poisoning of Mr. Navalny is just the latest example.

As president, I'll do what Trump won't: hold the Putin regime accountable for its crimes."
"I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns. 

What are you hiding, @realDonaldTrump?"
"They're rooting for chaos and violence because they think it helps them win a second term.

Now ask yourself, is that really who you think should be running the country?"
"If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, our planet may never recover."
"We’re just over two months from Election Day. But in many states, you don’t have to wait until November to make your voice heard.

Head to   and make a plan to vote early today."
Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are the worst possible people to lead our nation’s schools through this pandemic.
"We all want students back in the classroom, but President Trump hasn't done the work to make sure schools can reopen safely and effectively.

@KamalaHarris and I will be ready on day 1 with a roadmap for reopening."
President Trump has failed to address COVID-19 — and now our students and educators are paying the price. Tune in as I discuss my plan to safely and effectively reopen schools:
"This campaign is powered by grassroots supporters like you — and every dollar counts to close the fundraising gap with the Trump campaign. $5, $10, $15, whatever you can, chip in today:"
"Last month we raised $364.5 million — 95% of the donations from grassroots supporters like you and the majority online.

Working people are powering our campaign — and I’m grateful.

We’ve got a long way to go to close the fundraising gap and win — but we can do it. Together."
"Donald Trump is determined to instill fear and divide us, but what he doesn't understand is that fear never builds the future — hope does."
"For far too long, discriminatory policies like redlining have kept Black Americans from having the same opportunities as white Americans.

That’s got to change:"
"If I’m elected president, I promise you that America will be better prepared to deal with any threats that come our way.

That starts with restoring the PREDICT program that President Trump ended."
"Together, we’re going to build back better than before and set our nation on a new path."
.@DrBiden and I send our best wishes to members of the Jain faith concluding the holy observance of Paryushan and Das Lakshan. May we all find peace and reconciliation in our lives. Michhami Dukkaddam and Kshamavani!
We need a president who will lower the temperature and bring the country together — not one who raises it and tears us further apart.
Our nation is at an inflection point. @KamalaHarris and I sat down to discuss what brought us to this moment — and how we move forward and build back better than before. Tune in to watch:
"Across the country, people rely on public transportation to get to work, see loved ones, and access essential services. But that's all under threat because Republicans refuse to do their jobs.

Congress must act now to save public transit."
"Today’s press conference made it clear: we are all less safe because Donald Trump has failed at his job.

We need a President who will stop violence — not incite it."
President Shri Pranab Mukherjee was a devout public servant who believed deeply in the importance of our two nations tackling global challenges together. Jill and I are saddened to hear of his passing — our prayers go out to his loved ones and the Indian people.
"I urge President Trump to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is an important right — violence is wrong. Period.

If he can’t say that, then he is unfit to be President."
"Tonight, President Trump declined to rebuke violence.

He wouldn’t even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder.

He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it."
Fear never builds the future — hope does.
"If Donald Trump wants to ask the question: Who will keep you safer as President?

Let’s answer it."
"Donald Trump looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline.

He failed to protect America, so now he's trying to scare America."
"Folks, we're just hours away from our first end-of-month fundraising deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal and show Donald Trump we have what it takes to win in November.

"More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.

Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed.

Do you really feel safer under Trump?"
"Mr. President, it’s high time you condemn violence of any form."
"Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe.

Well, he is president — whether he knows it or not."
"Trump and Pence are running on this: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”

And what’s their proof?

The violence you’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America."
"The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now, he’s trying to scare America."
"I want a safe America — safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. 

And let’s be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump."
"Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is."
Donald Trump can’t stop the violence we're seeing today – because for years he has fomented it.  Tune in as I discuss the need for justice and safety in America:
Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
"We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:
 
COVID.
Economic devastation.
Unwarranted police violence.
Emboldened white nationalists.
A reckoning on race.
Declining faith in a bright American future.

The common thread? A president who makes things worse — not better."
"We’re going to build back better and we will do it while creating a brighter future for you and your families. This week @KamalaHarris and I sit down to discuss how we are going to move forward—together.

Join us on Tuesday."
"There’s a lot happening, but I hope we don’t overlook the brave fire fighters & emergency responders in the wake of Hurricane Laura.

When the storm hit, they stayed behind—even while their homes were being destroyed—to help their community recover.

True American heroes."

"Donald Trump has been president for almost four years.

The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper.

And all of us are less safe because he can’t do the job of the American president."
"We must not become a country at war with ourselves.

A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another.

But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are."
"The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable.

I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same."

It’s time we ensured all people are treated equally as well."
"The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed COVID response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump’s America?"
"America is at an inflection point.

The calls for racial justice that sparked the March on Washington 57 years ago are ringing out again today.

As we honor the legacy of that day — let's meet this moment with the urgency and action that our heroes marched for half a century ago."
Donald Trump put our nation on the sidelines. Let’s get back in the game.

"I am grateful for your friendship and leadership, @AbeShinzo. I’m sad to see you step down, but I know the strong alliance between our countries and peoples will continue for generations to come. Wishing you good health in the years ahead, my friend."
"Mr. President, Americans are canceling weddings and holding funerals without family. They're sacrificing so more Americans don't have to die.

But instead of leading by example, you hosted a super spreader event on the South Lawn.

When will you take the presidency seriously?"
"We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.

This is a moment of action.

It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer."
Times of crisis often bring out our best as Americans — and we're seeing that right now in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. Thank you to all of our emergency responders who are working around the clock to help people get back on their feet.

"The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better.

"Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president.
 
That’s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration."
"This morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents."
"We’ve all watched @KamalaHarris in the Senate go toe-to-toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked — and not stopping until she gets an answer. She’s ready to do this job."
"This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I will be speaking together for the first time since yesterday’s big announcement. Tune in:"
"Whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality—Kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. It's why I chose her to be my running mate.

She'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country."
"As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand.

Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans."
"If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we’re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won’t have a minute to waste.
 
That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one."
".@KamalaHarris is the daughter of proud immigrants—a mother from India and a father from Jamaica—who raised her to take action.

- The worst pandemic in 100 years
- The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression
- The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation

"Thanks to supporters like you, we are on track to have our biggest fundraising day ever. Together, we can win this.

"Let’s go win this, @KamalaHarris."
"Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in thiscampaign."
"I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate."
"Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless.

I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need."
"I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.

I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We'll get it done, together."
"This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong. Instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with Xi Jinping.

I'll put American values back at the center of our foreign policy."
Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement — giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career — and I'll continue that fight as president.
"Folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. Wear a mask. It’s not just about you. It’s about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe."

Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO.
"Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security.

We can't let that happen."
"President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable.

I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans."
"Donald Trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. 

After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do:"
"To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you — and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you."
Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
We can’t let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
Our planet can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
"Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November."
"The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn’t have gotten this bad."
"Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.

Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt."
"Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world."
"It’s an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I’ve picked as my running mate – text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I’ve made my decision."
"Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before."
"The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day."
"Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer."
"No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better."
"John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America.

Donald Trump will not."
"I can’t believe I have to say this, but we can’t let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining."
Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO.
"Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security.

We can't let that happen."
"President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable.

I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans."
"Donald Trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. 

After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do:"
"To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you — and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you."
Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
We can’t let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
Our planet can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
"Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November."
"The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn’t have gotten this bad."
"Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.

Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt."
"Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world."
"It’s an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I’ve picked as my running mate – text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I’ve made my decision."
"Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before."
"The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day."
"Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer."
"No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better."
"John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America.

Donald Trump will not."
"I can’t believe I have to say this, but we can’t let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining."
"I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone."
It didn't have to be this bad.
"Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans.

It's time we pick a different path."
Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump’s failure to get this virus under control.
"While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job."
The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price.
"Here’s how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump—Ducey model:

- An infection rate—still—of nearly 20%
- The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country
- More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19
- More than 183,000 cases
- Lengthy delays in test results"
"Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.

He’s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it.

He’s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk."
President Trump called Arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” He said Governor Ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in Arizona:
"My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future."
"Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place."
"Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all."
"I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we’ve got to:

- Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act
- Enact automatic and same-day voter registration
- Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts"
John Lewis left us with marching orders. It’s up to all of us to carry them out:
"Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I’ve learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can."
Let me be clear: Voting is a right — not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can’t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
"The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law."
"55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we’ve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote."
The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict—and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used.
"If I'm elected president, our students and educators will have all the tools and resources they need to succeed and get through COVID-19."
"I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone."

"Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector—and that was true even before COVID-19.

I’ll revitalize American manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better."
"Growing up in Scranton, I learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. Those values have guided my entire life — and they're the values I'll bring back to the White House."
"Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I’m announcing my running mate, and I promise I’ll let you know soon. But here’s what I can tell you right now: I’m going to tell my supporters first — so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know."
"I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. As president, I'll make bold investments in American manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America."
There's been a lot of talk about my vetting process lately. Here’s an inside look:
"Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the @NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons — and as president, I’ll ban these weapons again."
"Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence."
"I truly believe that we can revitalize American manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. I want to build an economy that brings everyone along — one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected."
"The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it."
"From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action. 

Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership."
"On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue."
"Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut. I urge both the Trump Administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast."
"Thousands of Americans are dying every week. The President's response?

""It is what it is."""
"I’ll get to work on day one enacting the changes needed to help the Latino community thrive.

Read my full plan here:"
"Happy birthday to my brother and friend, @BarackObama! Serving alongside you for eight years was the greatest honor of my life — and I'm grateful to have you by my side for these next 91 days."
"We can’t just build back to the way things were before these crises. We have to build a more inclusive, equitable future for all.

Here’s how we’ll do it:"
"The Latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. But even before, many Latino families were already struggling. We've got to do better. That's why today, I'm releasing my new agenda for the Latino community:"
"As president, I’ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic."
"One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver."
"On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to ""just disappear.""

He was wrong — and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month.

Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one."

That charge feels more important than ever. This is our fight — and together, we will win."
"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I’ll spend my Monday mornings working with our nation’s top experts to control this virus — not insulting them on Twitter."
"This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.

It won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win."
"One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.

It’s not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises — we need to build back better than ever. We have to create a new American economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
"Now more than ever, we need a president who believes in science."
This pandemic has put a bright light on the disparities that have plagued our nation for too long. We’ve got to make sure these communities get the help they need now — and root out the systemic racism that created these inequalities in the first place.
"Enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight.

We don’t have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus.

We need real leadership — and we need it now."
"It’s been over six months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, and President Trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day."

You won't have to worry about my tweets when I'm president.
Bill Barr is the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney.
"55 years ago today, Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law. And ever since, they've extended lives, enhanced liberty, and put the pursuit of happiness within reach for millions.

I'll protect and expand these programs for generations to come."
"Throughout his life, John Lewis taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.

It's up to all of us to carry on his mission."
It’s time Senate Republicans back their effusive praise of John Lewis with action. Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.
"Even after his passing, John Lewis reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation.

May his words guide us as we march on toward November."
"The last three months were the worst period for economic growth our nation has experienced in the 70 years since we started measuring it — a drop of nearly 33 percent.

Let's be clear: This is no act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership."
"I'm the proud husband of a teacher. I've seen firsthand how difficult the job can be in normal times — let alone in the middle of a pandemic. So when I heard Beth's story, I knew @BarackObama and I had to give her a call."
"Donald Trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now.

We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature."
We need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first.
"Folks, I'm excited to share that Senator @ewarren and I are hosting a grassroots fundraiser this Friday — and you're invited. We're going to chat about what's at stake this November and even answer a few of your questions.

"Donald Trump has shown that he can’t beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. And he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain.

He is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment."

We need this president to do his job."

America has never lived up to our founding promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do. My new plan will advance racial equity across the American economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals:
"My housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse President Trump’s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement.

We're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many Americans of color."
"To support more Black and Brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new Small Business Opportunity Initiative. We're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code."
"In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.

We have to break the cycle, and I’ve got a plan to do it:"
"This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It’s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people’s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome."
"A change of “tone” over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.

Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects."
"The Senate and this President should pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act — renamed yesterday in memory of John Lewis.

If they don’t, it will be one of the first things I do as president."
"I'm in Wilmington, Delaware, to unveil the fourth plank of my Build Back Better plan. Tune in as I discuss what my administration will do to advance racial equity in our economy:"
"In this moment, we have the chance to build an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. One more vibrant and more powerful because everyone is in on the deal.

Here's how we'll do it:"
"We can't build this nation back better without tackling the systemic racism and disparities that have plagued our country for far too long. That's why today, I'm releasing my new plan to advance racial economic equity across the American economy."
Our students and educators deserve better than four more years of Betsy DeVos. It’s time for a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.
"John — march on, dear friend. May God bless you. And may you continue to inspire righteous good trouble down from the Heavens."

- Ensure our government works for all, not just the wealthy few"
"In this moment of crisis, we have the chance to build a new American economy. One where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.

Together, we'll get it done."
Every day is National Ice Cream Day in my book.
"Mr. President, your ignorance isn’t a virtue or a sign of your strength — it’s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it’s costing Americans their jobs and their lives."
"The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the experts and refused to take action. He has failed our nation."
"Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear."
"Banning the Confederate flag from military installations was long overdue. 

Banning the LGBTQ Pride flag — the very symbol of diversity and inclusion — is undeniably wrong. The Pentagon should ensure it is authorized, or as President, I will."
"I know of no man with more courage than John Lewis. He was a giant walking among us. When I saw him, I couldn’t help but think one thing: “I haven’t done enough.” May his life and legacy inspire every one of us to strive for justice, equality and what is right."
My full statement:
"We are made in the image of God, and then there is John Lewis. He was truly one-of-a-kind, a moral compass who always knew where to point us and which direction to march. To John’s family, friends, staff, and constituents, Jill and I send you our love and prayers."
"As President, I will see to it that America once again stands for human rights. That doesn't mean rights only for some, but rights for all — each and every American, and every person, everywhere. No exceptions."
"Today, we lost a giant of the civil rights movement and a relentless champion in the struggle for justice. Reverend C.T. Vivian never stopped pushing our nation closer to our highest ideals — and we are better because of it. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers."
"Eleven. That's how many times we've broken the single-day record for new COVID-19 cases in the last month.

This virus isn't going to ""just disappear"" like President Trump wants. It's surging — and we need real leadership from this White House to slow its spread."
"I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t Donald Trump?

We deserve to know what this president is hiding."
Everyone wants our schools to reopen. The question is how to make it safe and how to make it stick. Forcing educators and students back into classrooms in areas where infection rates are going up or remaining too high is just plain dangerous.
"We have to make the places we live, work, and learn healthier and more energy-efficient. That's why my administration will upgrade 4 million buildings and weatherize 2 million homes across the country — creating over one million jobs in the process."
"No matter who you supported in 2016, I want you to know that you have a home in our campaign. You’re not just wanted — you’re needed.

Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and build this nation back better than it was before."
We have the power to write the future we want for our country. Don't let anyone tell you differently.
President Obama and I left a playbook for President Trump on how to fight pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're all paying the price every day.
"From day one, Donald Trump has been focused on the stock market and delivering for his wealthy friends and big corporations.

As president, I will be laser-focused on working families and small businesses."
"Let's call this what it is: A modern-day poll tax. It's unconscionable.

We need to restore voting rights for individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box."

"We are months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still being forced to reuse masks. It’s unacceptable.

Mr. President, fix the PPE shortages before you tee off for yet another round of golf."
"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a public health crisis."
"I don’t have Bitcoin, and I’ll never ask you to send me any.

But if you want to chip in to help make Donald Trump a one-term President, you can do that here:"
"Meeting the threat of climate change presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to jolt new life into our economy. We're going to create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future."
"There is no time to waste when it comes to addressing the existential threat of climate change. If I have the honor of being elected president, we'll get to work delivering results on day one."
"President Trump needs to do everything in his power to surge nationwide testing — including developing and evaluating more accurate, affordable, accessible, faster tests so we can reopen safely.

Infection rates are rising at an alarming pace. Mr. President, act now."
"Mr. President, “Open everything now,” isn’t a strategy for success. It’s barely a slogan. 

It’s long past time for you to step up and do your job."
"This pandemic has gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public.

I’m glad he made that shift — but it’s not enough.

We need real presidential leadership. Right now."
"We're facing an economic crisis and a climate crisis.  

As president, I'll create millions of jobs building resilient roads and bridges, manufacturing electric vehicles, and weatherizing homes and buildings. 

Learn more:"
"When I hear the words climate change, I hear the word ""jobs."" Good paying, union jobs that will solve our jobs crisis while addressing our climate crisis."
"Climate change is the challenge that's going to define our American future. And if I have the honor of being elected President, we won't tinker around the edges, we’ll seize this opportunity and meet this moment in history."
"When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, all he can muster is one word: “hoax.”
 
When I think about climate change, I think of a word as well: “jobs.”
 
Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work."
"Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff — or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration — Donald Trump announces it’s “Infrastructure Week.”

He's never delivered. I know how to get it done."
We can’t just build things back to the way they were — we’ve got to build America back better. Tune in as I deliver remarks on how we're going to invest in infrastructure and clean energy and create millions of jobs in the process:
"I want every single American to know: If you're sick, struggling, or worried about how you're going to get through the day, I will not abandon you.

We're all in this together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before."
We shouldn't have to beg this president to listen to the experts.
The hard truth is it didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump has squandered every chance he's had to contain the spread of this virus.
America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. My administration will invest $300 billion in research and development over four years to secure our global leadership and create millions of good-paying jobs.
"""We're leading the world."""
Donald Trump needs to spend less time playing golf and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci.

"In January, I sounded the alarm regarding COVID-19. 

Over five months later, President Trump still hasn't taken the action needed to respond to the virus. It's unacceptable.

This president has failed the American people every step of the way."
"The stakes couldn't be higher this November. Time and time again, Donald Trump has failed the people of Puerto Rico.

As President, I'll spur economic development on the island and expand access to health care."
"Together, we're going to build a new American economy:"
"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I'll actually listen to the experts and heed their advice. Not silence them."
"Mohamed Amashah is finally home after 486 days in Egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. Arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like Sarah Hegazy and Mohamed Soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. No more blank checks for Trump’s ""favorite dictator."""
"Ignore the polls.

We’ve got work to do:"
"Health care is personal to me. And as president, I'll do everything I can to make sure every American has access to the care they need."
"We need a president who will always choose to unite rather than divide, because there’s nothing we can’t accomplish when we do it together."
"To all the nurses on the frontlines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes."
"Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.

We need real leadership, right now. Lives are at stake."
"Back in January, when President Trump signed his hollow ""phase one"" trade deal with Beijing, I made clear that no one should be fooled by Trump's empty promises to deliver a meaningful “phase two"" deal.

Good to see that he's finally admitting I was right."
"I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. Every day that he remains in office, he further threatens the future of our democracy.

We have to vote him out this November."
"I have no illusion about how tough the road ahead is. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.

Given a chance, ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things."
"This was almost two months ago. 

Since then? Tens of thousands more lives lost. A million and a half new cases.

The President? Still golfing."
"The United States has over 3 million cases of COVID-19, and over 130,000 people have died — yet Donald Trump continues to say it will just ""fade away."" It’s unbelievable.

We're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day."
"I see a different America than President Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity, and justice.

I know we can reach our highest ideals — together."
Still true.
"Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you’ve been knocked down. Respect for hard work, and for the people who do it.
 
Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton — and they're the values I’ll take to the Oval Office."
This is what “America First” looks like under President Trump:
"Through every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger — and we will again."

"Here's my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected president, I will take care of your family like I would my own."
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
We can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.
This is our moment to imagine and build a new American economy — one where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
"I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past.
 
American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now."
We can't just focus on the jobs of today — we have to also focus on the jobs and industries of tomorrow. I'll make a historic $300 billion investment in research and development that will spur innovation and help create 3 million jobs across the nation.
"American workers can out-compete anyone, but they need a government that fights for them. I'll revitalize American manufacturing — especially smaller manufacturers and those owned by women and people of color — and ensure the future is made here in America."
"When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products & support American jobs.

But under Trump, the rate of federal contractors offshoring jobs more than doubled. It's unacceptable.

I'll invest $400 billion in American-made products & keep jobs here at home."
"I'm in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plan to create jobs, raise wages, and help America build back better. Tune in to watch:"
"We're in the middle of an economic crisis. But it's not enough to just turn things around — we have to build back better. We have to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made in America — by all of America.

Here's how we'll do it:"
The future must be made in America — by all of America. Here's how we'll do it:
As I was saying.
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We need a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.
"I commend the Task Forces for their service and for helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. And I am deeply grateful to @BernieSanders for working with us to unite our party and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come."
Increased testing isn’t the reason for the surge in coronavirus cases — Donald Trump's failed leadership is.
"Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.

He's spread racism against our Latino community ever since.

We need to work in partnership with Mexico.

We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.

That's what I'll do as President."
Let me be clear: No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can’t pay rent.
"When there were 15 cases, the President said it wouldn't spread any farther. 

We just hit our 3 millionth case.

We're paying for his failure."
".@AdyBarkan — The courage you show every day is an inspiration to so many, and I'm grateful to have you by my side in this fight. We may not agree on everything, but this we do: Health care is a right — not a privilege. And we're going to make that a reality, together."

This is a national disgrace. We have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately — and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on.
The most sacred obligation of our government is to keep our troops safe when we send them into battle — and to care for them when they come home. We need a president who will honor that obligation.
"Across the world, people come to this country with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. They study here, innovate here, they make America who we are. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does."
"Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as President, I will rejoin the @WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage."
"We've seen what happens when the federal government fails to secure sufficient supplies of critical products like PPE — and we can't let it happen again. So today, I'm releasing my plan to rebuild U.S. supply chains:"
Donald Trump needs to do his job.
Character belongs in the White House.
"To beat COVID-19, we need a coordinated national response from the federal government — but Donald Trump refuses to do his job. I've laid out exactly what I would do, and I encourage this president to adopt the plan in its entirety:"
"There’s enormous opportunity once we defeat Donald Trump. We are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than they've ever been before."
The nation is crying out for leadership — leadership that can unite us and bring us together. But this president has nothing to offer.
"With COVID-19 surging across the nation, Donald Trump should be doing everything in his power to increase access to testing. Instead, he's doing the opposite. It's despicable."
It didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump failed to do his job — and we're all paying the price.
We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump.
"We're going to beat Donald Trump. And when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation — we'll transform it."
"There are so many unsung heroes in our communities, especially in times of crisis. We owe Alassane and countless others a debt of gratitude — and I'll fight for them every day in the White House."
"On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. It’s time for free and fair elections so that the Venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime."
"COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped."
"Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he’s wrong — on both fronts.

We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises."
"The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the warnings and refused to take action. He failed our nation."
I’ve carried the middle class values that my parents instilled in me my entire life — and they’re the values I’ll bring to the White House.
This is a national disgrace. We have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately — and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on.

We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump.
"We're going to beat Donald Trump. And when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation — we'll transform it."
"There are so many unsung heroes in our communities, especially in times of crisis. We owe Alassane and countless others a debt of gratitude — and I'll fight for them every day in the White House."
"On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. It’s time for free and fair elections so that the Venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime."
"COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped."
"Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he’s wrong — on both fronts.

We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises."
"The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the warnings and refused to take action. He failed our nation."
I’ve carried the middle class values that my parents instilled in me my entire life — and they’re the values I’ll bring to the White House.
"Make no mistake, our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there’s not a single thing we cannot do."
The health care workers on the frontlines of this fight are some of the greatest heroes our nation has ever seen.
"America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all — and it's long past time we lived up to it."
American history isn’t a fairytale. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. But it’s a battle we can and will win — together.
"This Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask."
"Our nation was founded on a simple idea: We're all created equal. We've never lived up to it — but we've never stopped trying. This Independence Day, let's not just celebrate those words, let's commit to finally fulfill them. Happy #FourthOfJuly!"
"“If you put the wrong person in office, you'll see things that you would not have believed are possible."""
"It didn't have to be this bad. But month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us.

Here's what I'll do as president:"
"It’s abundantly clear that this virus isn’t going to just “fade away,” Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up, take action, and lead."
"Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose science over fiction."
"Donald Trump styled himself as a wartime president. But now it seems this president has surrendered. He has waved the white flag and left the field of battle when we need him most. It's unacceptable.

We need real leadership. Right now."
"We are five months into this crisis, and our health care workers still don't have the masks and protective equipment they need. It's a national disgrace.

Mr. President, use your authority and fix the shortage of PPE before you tee off for yet another round of golf."
"Donald Trump has called himself a ""cheerleader"" for the nation. But we don't need a cheerleader — we need a President. One who will:

- Lead by example
- Take responsibility
- Tell the unvarnished truth
- Listen to the experts and follow the science"
Wear a mask.
"Let me be clear: There’s no victory to be celebrated when we’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better."
This is a job Donald Trump is entirely unfit for.
"“Mr. President, it's too much.”"
"This is a shameful move. Now is the time for employers to have empathy for families juggling work and caregiving.

It's long past time for President Trump to show some leadership so we can get this virus under control."
Tune in as I address the nation on the economic crisis and the latest jobs report:
"Mr. President, this pandemic isn't about you. It's about the health and well-being of the American people."
"Make no mistake, our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there’s not a single thing we cannot do."

125 days.
I’ll read my daily briefings.
"Small businesses are the backbone of communities across our nation, and we need to do so much more to help them. Donald Trump may have forgotten about them — but I never will."
"If the reports are true, Donald Trump either read his briefings about the Russian bounties and did nothing — or he didn't read them at all. Either way, it's an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.

The American people deserve answers."
"On day one, I’ll get right to work tackling COVID-19. I'll bring together our nation's top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We are all in this together — and we've got to fight this together."
"We need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period.

It’s not just about you — it’s about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It’s about keeping other people safe."
"This is my promise to you: When I am President, I will take care of your health care coverage and your family the same way I would my own."
"As #ImmigrantHeritageMonth comes to a close, I want to make one thing clear: Immigrants have always made our nation stronger — our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength.

Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does."
"Folks, we’re just a few hours away from our end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way to helping us catch up to Donald Trump.

If you can, please chip in today:"
"On the final day of #PrideMonth, here’s my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected, I will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law."
"We’re facing a serious threat — and we need to meet it together as one country. But this President gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another.

We can't continue on like this."
"If I’m elected, I’ll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. 

I’ll have the nation’s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one — and I'll actually listen to them."
"Mr. President, the American people didn’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.

Step up. Take responsibility. Do your job."
"Tune in as I deliver remarks on how President Trump failed to protect the American people, save our economy, and control the virus:"
"I want every single American to know: if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day — I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.

We are going to get through this — together."
"As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself."
"Folks, tomorrow night marks our first end-of-quarter deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal so we can catch up to Donald Trump's hefty cash-on-hand advantage.
 
I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today:"
The President spent his weekend golfing.
Here’s my promise to you: I’ll appoint a director who will actually go after financial predators and protect consumers.
"Today's decision reaffirmed that states can't put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions—but the fight isn't over. As President, I'll codify Roe v. Wade and protect a woman’s constitutional right to choose."

White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history — not promoted by the President of the United States.

This is yet another attempt to distract from this Administration's failure to lead an effective response to COVID-19. Immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. The President can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis.

"Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolas Maduro. 

As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy."
"Trump opposed sanctioning China’s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.

"It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before."
Speed up the testing.
I've found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose. Christian Cooper and I discussed how we can take our collective pain in this moment and turn it into a catalyst for change:
"This nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but Trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. 

As president, I'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America. #WorldRefugeeDay"
Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains:
"Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.

Unbelievable."

As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy."
"Trump opposed sanctioning China’s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.

Where Trump has been weak, I will be strong, clear, and consistent in standing up for America's values and its people."
"My dad instilled a lot in me, but perhaps most important is the belief that there’s no higher calling than to be a good parent. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads working to help raise their children — and all our children — to be honorable, generous, and kind."
"I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing — not slowing it down."
"It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before."
Speed up the testing.
I've found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose. Christian Cooper and I discussed how we can take our collective pain in this moment and turn it into a catalyst for change:
"This nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but Trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. 

As president, I'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America. #WorldRefugeeDay"
Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains:
"Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.

Unbelievable."
"The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.

It’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921."
"Christian Cooper’s encounter in Central Park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. I'm grateful for Christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done."
"We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:

- Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs
- Stands in the way of the CDC
- Refuses to wear a mask

He is failing even the most basic test of leadership."
"I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.

None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent."
Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
"I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake.

That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election:"
"#Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all."
"Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump."
To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you. #HomeIsHere
"The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court — and the generational impact its justices can have.

We have the power to shape the Court's future this November — and we can’t forget that."
"I'm ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready?"
Dreamers are Americans. Period.
"Just like Donald Trump couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April — he can’t ignore it away in June."
"Here’s my promise to you: On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue."
"It didn’t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.

We need a president who will put the American people first — and actually do the work."
"Thanks, Barack. You're right — and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country."
"Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it."
"The Supreme Court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. And as President, I will get to work immediately to make it permanent."
"Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.

Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated."
"Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.

That's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.

It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President."
"The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.

I’m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today’s #WorkersFirst Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the #HeroesAct now and take action to root out systemic racism.
"If John Bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values."
"Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it — and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.

This president has failed to lead our nation."
"Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world — killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind."
"I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in:"
"The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.

It has to change."
We need a president who chooses unity over division.
"I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history."
"We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.

Let’s do it together."
"We can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible."
"Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement — and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward:"
"This virus won’t just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up and do your job."
Los Dreamers son estadounidenses. Trump les quitó la protección que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. Esto es inaceptable. El primer día de mi presidencia enviaré un proyecto de ley al Congreso que protegerá a los beneficiarios de DACA de la deportación.

"Folks, I’ve got some big news: Next week, I’m getting together with my friend and former boss, President @BarackObama, for a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We would love to see you there.

"Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It’s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress."
"I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.
 
It's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the American ideal finally wins out."
"I'm grateful for @PPact's support and proud to stand with them in this fight. As president, I’m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care — including reproductive health care."
"Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response."
"Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.

Here’s what I would do as president:"

We can do it, together."
"Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation — not use them for political gain.

We shouldn’t accept anything less from an American president."

"While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.
 
He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country — and hardworking Americans are paying the price."
"We have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong — and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen:"

And yet he’s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable."
Small businesses like Rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. We have to do so much more to help them through this crisis.
"Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.
 
We need justice. We need action. We need reform."
"Grief is a heavy burden to bear — and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose — to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.

That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service:"
"My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.

Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.

I'm a Catholic – just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either."
13 million people who had jobs when you took office are unemployed today.
"Together, let’s make this an era of action."
"This moment is a wake-up call for all of us. It's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many."
"Donald Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the Obama-Biden Administration, but like everything else he’s inherited, he has squandered it."
"To everyone speaking out and peacefully demanding justice across the nation: I see you, I hear you, and I stand with you."
"At every turn, President Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day."
"We've made incredible progress on LGBTQ+ equality, but we still have further to go. We can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or whom they love.

Join #OutForBiden and let's get to work:"
"We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.
 
It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions."
"American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.

Don't let anyone tell you differently."
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward.
These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps.
We need to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth.
"This isn’t about politics. This is about the future of our country. Grateful for your support, Secretary Powell."
"The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.
 
We cannot give him another four years in the White House."
"We need to stand up as a nation — with the Black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.
 
It is the duty of every American to grapple with it — and grapple with it now."

"I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.
 
We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again."
"To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won’t ever forget you. And I won’t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you."
"Today, we honor those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay"
"Today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause. 

No one can stay silent."
"We're just 150 days out from Election Day, and the stakes have never been higher. We have to defeat Donald Trump, and once we do, we won’t just rebuild this country — we'll transform it. Together.
 
Help us make it happen:"
"Donald Trump was warned, but he failed to act. Now more than 20 million Americans are out of a job and paying the price. It didn’t have to be this bad."
150 days.
"Folks, tonight we secured the 1,991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. I'm going to spend every day fighting to earn your vote so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation."
"Tonight, I’m thinking of Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Today should have been her daughter's birthday. I've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. But for Breonna and Tamika, it’s on us to find purpose. Our country needs to act — now."
Donald Trump still doesn’t get it. He’s out there spiking the football — completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives.
"This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.

The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop."
"When it comes to this economic crisis, Donald Trump either doesn’t know what’s going on, or he just doesn’t care."
Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it:
Let’s be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God — but to the failure of a President.
"George Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.

For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable."
Tune in as I speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy:
Those who have worked the closest with Donald Trump know how unfit he is to serve as President.
It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
"We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.
 
We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.
 
We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us."

"To everyone struggling with mental health—you're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.
 
Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma."
"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you."
"We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists."
"Jim Mattis and I haven’t always agreed on everything, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more powerful indictment of Trump's actions and character than the one he's written. 
""We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose."""
"I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.

It's up to all of us to create the America we know we can be."
"More than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest."
There’s no time to waste — we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman @Hakeem_Jeffries has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump’s desk in the next few days. Period.
The nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.
"Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.

I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be?"
We need a president who listens.
"It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress — and we have that chance once again. We’re not just going to rebuild this nation — we’re going to transform it. 

There is nothing we can’t do if we do it together."
"If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be."
"I ask all of America — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy."
"If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.

No more excuses. No more delays."
"When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.

When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.

Donald Trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself."
"The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won’t either.

But I promise you this: I won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain."
"That’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us."
"“I can’t breathe.”
 
George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation.
 
It’s a wake-up call for all of us."
Julián — I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on — and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support.
"I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.

Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important—who we want to be. It’s all at stake.
 
That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward."

That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America."

"Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in:"

"He's using the American military against the American people.

He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.

For a photo.

For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together."
"In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.
 
We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.
 
We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives."
Leaders listen.
"After another night of unrest in America, I’m hosting a virtual roundtable with mayors from across the country to discuss where we go from here. Tune in:"
"We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. 

As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington."
"We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other."
Trump’s Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from @WHO during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19.
"If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.

None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out."
"You can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back.

We all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable."
"Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel."
"Every day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president."
"This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.

This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now."
"We are a country with an open wound.

None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words — “I can’t breathe” — and do nothing.

We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being."
"It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.

It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.

We need justice for George Floyd."

"This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything."
Enough.
We can’t allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation.
"We’re months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.
 
I do:"
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and we’re seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope.
"100,000+ lives lost across the country.
1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.
40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.

Donald Trump has failed our nation."
"Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure of leadership."
"Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities:"
The hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.
Two tweets from the same day in October.
Every day Donald Trump proves how unfit he is to lead our nation.
Presidents are supposed to lead by example — and every day Donald Trump proves how incapable he is of doing that.
George Floyd’s life mattered.
".@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. His outspokenness raised our consciousness on HIV/AIDS and saved countless lives."
"There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.

To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you."
"Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.

Read more from @TammyforIL and me:"
"We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.

It’s morally reprehensible."

"I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too."
"This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything."
Enough.
We can’t allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation.
"We’re months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.
 
I do:"
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and we’re seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope.
"100,000+ lives lost across the country.
1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.
40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.

Donald Trump has failed our nation."
"Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure of leadership."
"Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities:"
The hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.
Two tweets from the same day in October.
Every day Donald Trump proves how unfit he is to lead our nation.
Presidents are supposed to lead by example — and every day Donald Trump proves how incapable he is of doing that.
George Floyd’s life mattered.
".@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. His outspokenness raised our consciousness on HIV/AIDS and saved countless lives."
"There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.

To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you."
"Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.

Read more from @TammyforIL and me:"
"We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.

It’s morally reprehensible."
Tune in now as @TomWolfPA joins me for a conversation on how COVID-19 is impacting states:
"This morning, I’ll be joined by @TomWolfPA for a conversation on how COVID-19 is making an impact on states.

"Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.

Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.

I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November."
"George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.

I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation."
Wear a mask.
"Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.

We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy."
"The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these. But we’re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.

If you can, please chip in today:"
1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.
"Folks, today we’re launching #League46⚾️ — a next generation coalition ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president. We've got unlimited capacity to create change — and together, we’re going to transform this country.

Join today:"
So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
"We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look:"
There’s not a single thing the American people can’t do if we do it together.
"We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities — and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come."
"This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box."
"To all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget. #MemorialDay"
The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.
"Hunger today isn’t about scarcity — it’s about a massive failure in leadership. 

If I were President, I’d immediately work with @chefjoseandres to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis."
"We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is trying to prevent people from getting health care."
"Folks write letters to me asking all kinds of questions, but Jack's question on my favorite ice cream flavor might be the best one yet.

Here’s what I told him:"
Make no mistake: I believe our best days still lie ahead. We can and will transform this nation — together.
"Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work.

Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing."

"Donald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. It’s unacceptable.

I’ll make meaningful investments in Indian Country — including increasing funding for Indian Health Services and making that funding mandatory."
We can protect the sacred right to vote and protect public health at the same time.
"The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."
"36,000 Americans could be alive today if President Trump had acted sooner. Let's put that into perspective:"
"We're in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetime, and Senate Republicans continue to delay relief for the American people saying, ""I don’t see the need right now."" Unbelievable.

We've got to take back the Senate this November."

"We will get through this, and we will come out stronger. I promise."
"In announcing the intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, President Trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership."
"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: No company pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.

We don't have a food shortage problem — we have a leadership problem.

Donald Trump has failed to provide for our nurses and doctors on the frontlines. Now he’s short-changing our troops and their families. Unacceptable.
"Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide."

"It seems the way to get fired by President Trump is not to commit wrongdoing, but to investigate it."
Science over fiction.
"The fact is Donald Trump wasted an awful lot of time, and lives were lost as a consequence."
I want Donald Trump to look the American people in the eye and explain why their hard-earned dollars are bailing out his wealthy donors.

"From this moment of crisis, we have the opportunity to not just rebuild our economy — but transform it."
Every day Donald Trump proves how wholly unfit he is to lead our country.
We need a president who puts hardworking Americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected.
"Defeating Donald Trump is going to take everything we've got. His campaign has been preparing for the last four years and has millions in the bank. I know times are tough, but if you can, please pitch in today to help us catch up:"
"On this Armed Forces Day, @DrBiden and I want to express our gratitude and support for the men and women in uniform — serving and defending our country around the world. Thank you for your selfless service and sacrifice. You continue to make us proud."
"It seems the way to get fired by President Trump is not to commit wrongdoing, but to investigate it."
Science over fiction.
"The fact is Donald Trump wasted an awful lot of time, and lives were lost as a consequence."
I want Donald Trump to look the American people in the eye and explain why their hard-earned dollars are bailing out his wealthy donors.

What he said.
"Donald Trump can deflect and shift blame all he wants, but the hard truth is he failed to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime."
"Sherian, a small business owner from South Carolina, recently asked how I would help businesses like hers recover from this crisis and how we can tackle health care disparities among communities of color. They're important questions. Here's what I said:"
The lives of tens of millions of Americans have been thrown into chaos through no fault of their own — and Donald Trump simply isn't doing enough to help them.
"Join me for a virtual roundtable on COVID-19 with Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont who are at the forefront of this crisis:"
Small businesses are the backbone of this country. We have to do so much more to support them through this crisis. Here's what I would do if I were president:
"With the void of leadership in the White House, governors across the country have stepped up to meet this moment. This afternoon, I’ll be joined by a few of them for a roundtable discussion on COVID-19. 

Tune in at 3:30 PM ET to watch:"
"As the economy continues to spiral downwards and unemployment soars to Great Depression-era levels, we cannot ignore the hard truth: This crisis hit us harder and will take longer to recover from because of Donald Trump’s failures."
"There's nothing that the American people cannot accomplish when we stand together — one nation, united in purpose."
Happy Birthday to the one and only @StevieWonder.
"“60 days into the coronavirus crisis, the White House does not have a plan, a framework, a philosophy, or a goal.”

Real presidents lead. Reality TV presidents don’t."
"Not only does the Trump Administration want to take away health coverage for millions in the middle of a pandemic, but now they want to let people go hungry, too. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds."
"Moments of crisis require swift and decisive action from our leaders, but Donald Trump and his administration have done nothing but dither and delay. They have failed the American people on every single front."
"I would trust the guy who’s one of our nation's top public health experts, not the one who pondered injecting disinfectant into the body and looked directly at a solar eclipse."
"Enough with the anger and division and fear-mongering, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up, appeal to our better angels, and unite the country. We'll overcome this crisis by coming together — not by tearing each other apart."
It didn’t have to be this bad. Donald Trump utterly failed to prepare for this pandemic and delayed in taking the necessary steps to safeguard our nation against the near-worst-case-economic scenario we are now living.
We owe so much to every single worker on the front lines of this crisis. The least we can do is provide them the pay and protection they need and deserve. Here's what I would do if I were president:
"I joined @PeterHamby on @Snapchat’s Good Luck America to discuss everything from memes to stimulus oversight. Head to   to watch the interview today, Thursday, and Friday."
A united party is key to winning the White House this November. The work of the task forces will be essential to identifying ways to build on our progress and not simply turn the clock back to a time before Donald Trump — but transform our country.
"Donald Trump can put up all of the banners he wants in the Rose Garden, but it doesn’t change the fact that he failed our nation when it comes to COVID-19 testing."

".@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Aimee Stephens. We send our deepest condolences to her wife, Donna, and her family. Aimee's spirit and courage will not only be her legacy but our guiding light as we carry on her fight for equality."
"The Trump Administration clearly knows what's needed to make workplaces safe and operational: adequate testing, contact tracing, masks, and additional precautions.

They're putting in the work to keep themselves safe. Why aren't they doing the same for the American people?"
"This is a bunch of malarkey and you know it, @senatemajldr. We left a 69-page playbook on how to fight pandemics.

You can read it here if you’d like:  

And make sure to pass along your notes to President Trump. He could use them."
Donald Trump knew about this crisis all the way back in January — and his response since has been incompetent at best.
That’s the plan.
"Here's the deal: We can choose who our country works for. We can choose whether it works for just the wealthy — or everyone else as well.

That’s the choice we must make — all of us together — this November."
"Let me be clear: My Administration will review every single stimulus loan given to big companies and political insiders. We will find any dollar taken corruptly, we will come get it, and we will punish the wrongdoers."
I believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.
Donald Trump just doesn't understand: We have an economic crisis because we have a public health crisis — and we have a public health crisis because he failed to act.
"In April, we raised $60.5 million between my campaign and @TheDemocrats. I'm humbled and know what a sacrifice it is to give in times as difficult as these. But May is our most important month yet, and we need your help. If you can, please chip in today:"
Donald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it’s unnecessary for the American people?
"With folks staying at home during this time of social distancing, we put together some fun activities to keep everyone entertained. Text FREE to 30330 to be the first to get a look at what we’ve been working on."
"Donald Trump hopes to split us into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.

It’s a childish tactic—and a false choice none of us should fall for."
I have a better idea: give people coronavirus economic relief and don't hold their hard-earned benefits hostage.
"This crisis presents an opportunity to not just rebuild our economy — but transform it. @AndrewYang joined me to discuss how we can do that and create a stronger, fairer, more inclusive middle class.

Listen to the full episode:"
"No podemos callar ante la violencia contra personas transgénero de color, como las recientes tragedias en Missouri y Puerto Rico. Es nuestra obligación garantizar que todos puedan vivir abiertamente, con orgullo y sin miedo."
"We cannot be silent in the face of rising violence against transgender people of color—like the recent tragedies in Missouri and Puerto Rico. It's our moral obligation to end this epidemic, and ensure everyone can live open and proud and free from fear."

"Tax cuts for the super-wealthy.
Bailouts for large corporations.
Working Americans left behind.

That’s Donald Trump’s record."
"I believe rebuilding the middle class is the moral obligation of our time. We have to build a stronger, more inclusive, more resilient middle class — one that can withstand the next public health crisis or whatever else comes our way."
"Ordinary people, given half a chance, have never let their country down.

That’s who I believe in. That’s who I’m in this race to fight for."
"To the extraordinary mothers everywhere, like Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, my wishes for a safe and happy Mother’sDay."
"There's a clear choice this November:

Donald Trump will do everything he can to terminate health care for millions in a global pandemic.

I will do everything I can to ensure every American has access to the quality, affordable care they need."
There’s no quit in America. None at all. We’re going to get through this — and we're going to come out stronger.
This is inexcusable.
No one should pay a dollar out of pocket for coronavirus testing or treatment. Period.
Imagine what we could be doing now with the $2 trillion in tax cuts that Donald Trump delivered for his rich friends.
"We need to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along.

We have to make sure every single person gets a fair shot at success."
Crisis reveals character — and character belongs in the White House.
Ahmaud Arbery was shot down in cold blood. His family deserves justice — and they deserve it now.
"Make no mistake: COVID-19 has caused a massive economic challenge. But this crisis hit us harder, and will last longer, because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength."
"Two years ago, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran Deal. This week, he vetoed a war powers resolution that would've prevented him from starting a war with Iran without Congressional consent. His decisions have increased the risk of war in the Middle East."
"Corruption is a feature of Donald Trump's economic agenda—not a bug. He will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.

I say it’s time we pick a different way—one where everyone gets a fair shot at success, not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd."
"75 years ago on #VEDay, America and its allies defeated fascism in Europe. From the devastation of war, we built a lasting peace. Today, as we honor the veterans who sacrificed for us, let us remember the importance of uniting against common threats."
It didn’t have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump was simply not up to the job.
I’m the proud husband of a teacher who inspires me every day. I’ve seen firsthand how hard teachers work with little support and few resources. Thank you to all the amazing teachers who've inspired and educated the future of our country. #TeacherAppreciationWeek

"The choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. We have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy."
"It’s important to stay connected while we’re social distancing — but there’s always that one friend who doesn’t get the hint when it’s time to end the video chat. 

Glad we don’t know anyone like that — right, @KeeganMKey?"
"It's been a big few weeks. President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and Speaker Pelosi all endorsed our campaign. Now, we need your help to keep the momentum going.

I know times are tough, but if you can, please chip in today:"
"Each week, I get hundreds of letters from people across the country. Folks share their hopes, ideas, struggles, and concerns — and I try to respond to as many as I can. We're going to share a few of them with you in our new series: Sincerely, Joe."
"Thank you to all the:

Firefighters
Paramedics
Police officers
Doctors
Nurses
Medical support staff
Grocery and retail workers
Meatpackers
Delivery drivers
Transit workers
And everyone else on the front lines of this fight.

You truly are the heart and soul of this country."
"Let me be clear: Essential workers on the front lines of this crisis deserve premium pay, emergency paid sick leave, and protections that keep them safe."
"Across the country, folks are stepping up, taking care of their neighbors, and lending a hand to those in need. It's who we are. In times of crisis, we stand as one. And it makes me so proud to be an American."
"Today, I’m releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the African American community and take us one step closer to making America what it ought to be. Read more:"
"Over 1 million cases of COVID-19. Almost 70,000 dead. What is upsetting President Trump? Tough questions from the press.

Cry me a river, Mr. President."
"Make no mistake: We can emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. It’s within our power — we just need a president and an administration who are up for the task."
I've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one America. This crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. There's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.
"In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president."
"The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately — all of it stems from Donald Trump’s failures as president."
"This Sunday night, settle in and join labor leader Dolores Huerta, actor John Leguizamo, Secretary Hilda Solis, and Congresswoman Escobar for a #TodosConBiden discussion. Tune in now:"
"The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together."
"Donald Trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he’s trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich — all without any accountability. @EWarren and I think that’s unacceptable."
"This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable — especially not in the White House."
"Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government."
A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.
The U.S. Postal Service is an essential pillar of American life. We simply cannot let Donald Trump destroy it.
"Over the last few weeks, I worked with our supporters and staff to create a code for our campaign—the principles we’ll live by, reflecting the community we’ve built, the team we aspire to be, and some of my own ‘rules’ as well.

This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the nation and around the world — to solve this crisis.
"When I say Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history, this is what I'm talking about.

Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it."
"We left a playbook. He ignored it.

We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it.

We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out.

Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared."
Mi corazón y el de Jill están con Puerto Rico a raíz de los terremotos de hoy. Mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del COVID-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo más pronto posible.
"My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible."
"To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet.

To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding."
"On March 6th, Donald Trump said: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

It was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.

This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide."
"When we come together and act as one America, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish."
No one should have to pay for coronavirus treatment. Period.
"I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America. The president should encourage folks to follow Gov. Whitmer’s public health orders — not sow further discord and division."
"As we mark the beginning of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, @DrBiden and I extend our best wishes to AANHPI communities across America. We look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead."
"When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We have to build a better future for all.

We can and will transform this nation — together."
"This crisis isn't about you, Mr. President. It's about the American people."
"We have lived long enough with a President who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That’s not me. As a Presidential candidate, I’m accountable to the American people."
We need a president who listens.
"We need more tests. Our front line workers need protective equipment. Americans need additional economic relief.

Yet the Trump Administration is spending time and energy on President Trump's wasteful border wall.

Unbelievable."
"The number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.

We have to do more to help them. Now."
"- More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died
- 30 million have filed for unemployment
- At least 1 million have gotten sick

Enough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead."
"Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April.

He was wrong. And we're all paying the price."
An open and independent press is more important than ever in times like this. They deserve to be treated with respect — not belittled with schoolyard taunts from this president.

"As president, I promise you I'll honor all those we've lost from COVID-19."
"The climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action to combat it before it's too late."
"In the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is still working to gut the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.

They need to drop the lawsuit immediately."
"With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions."
"The words of a president matter — and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19, pass blame onto others, and mislead the American people. I will do the opposite."
"The Trump Admin failed to provide enough testing, PPE, and safety enforcement. Workers have gotten sick, plants have closed, and the meat supply is at risk. It's past time workers have the protections they need to stay healthy and do their job safely."

Donald Trump needs to scale up testing, and he needs to do it immediately."

We shouldn’t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability."

It’s stories like these that make me so proud to be an American and make me confident that we will overcome this. Because there’s nothing the American people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
"After seeing the shortage of masks around the country, Marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in Northern Virginia to make homemade masks. Because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe."

"We may be physically apart, but folks across the country are coming together to check in on their neighbors and thank our front line heroes. Use #SOULSaturday to show how you’re participating today."
"When I announced my campaign one year ago today, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation.

One year later, that is as true as it has ever been. I believe we can and we will emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. Together, as one America."
Donald Trump needs to step up and do everything he can to give our front line workers the protective equipment they need.
"I know times are tough, but we have to campaign as hard as ever to take the strongest fight possible to Donald Trump. He has a lot more money than us, and we need your help to close the gap.

If you can, please chip in today:"
"Folks, to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we'll be hosting a #SOULSaturday Rally tomorrow night! We may be physically apart, but I hope you'll join us in coming together at 7 PM ET:"
"The health of the American people is not a joke, Mr. President."
"I can’t believe I have to say this, but please don’t drink bleach."
"Let me be clear: This crisis isn’t about you, Mr. President."
"Julie, I can’t thank you enough for all you’re doing to ensure folks have food and supplies during this crisis."
"This is great, Addie. Tell your mom and sister I say thank you for lending a helping hand to your neighbors."
"Amanda, this is remarkable. Thank you for stepping up and supporting our front line heroes. I know the staff will greatly appreciate your donations."
"Today, folks across the nation have showed their compassion by participating in our first ever #SOULSaturday.  Tune in now as we end the day with a celebration for our campaign’s one year anniversary:"
"One year ago, we launched this campaign. Whether you were on #TeamJoe from day one or have joined in recent weeks — I’m incredibly grateful for your support and hope I make you proud. Together, we’re going to beat Donald Trump, unite this country, and transform our nation."
It’s stories like these that make me so proud to be an American and make me confident that we will overcome this. Because there’s nothing the American people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
"After seeing the shortage of masks around the country, Marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in Northern Virginia to make homemade masks. Because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe."
"Older adults are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Recognizing that, Erica decided to organize youth in her community to buy groceries for seniors — ensuring they receive the food they need while staying safe at home. She's a true hero."
"Brien usually works at the Ford Plant in Rawsonville, Michigan, driving a semi. But when the plant started assembling much-needed ventilators, he courageously stepped up and volunteered to help. His selfless actions will no doubt save countless lives."
"John, a Facilities Maintainer from Staten Island, recently contracted and survived the coronavirus. Shortly after he recovered, a colleague contracted the virus and needed plasma to battle it. John heroically stepped up and donated his plasma to help his coworker."

"Today, we remember the atrocities faced by the Armenian people in the Metz Yeghern — the Armenian Genocide. If elected, I pledge to support a resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide and will make universal human rights a top priority."
"No matter who you supported throughout the primary, I want you to know that you have a home in our campaign. You’re not just wanted —you’re needed. Together, we will beat Donald Trump and transform this nation.

Join us:"
These folks are American heroes.
"I know this is a dark time for so many people, just know that we will get through this. We will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever before."
"UV light? Injecting disinfectant?

Here’s an idea, Mr. President: more tests. Now. And protective equipment for actual medical professionals."
"The words of a president matter — never more than in times of crisis. A president should seek to calm and heal, provide a steady hand, and a clear path forward.

Instead, this is what we get from Donald Trump:"
Donald Trump will always put his wealthy and well-connected friends first — that should come as no surprise. But to allow the banks to do it on the backs of small business owners in the middle of a global pandemic is a new low — even for him.
"To celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting our first #SOULSaturday this weekend. Folks across the nation will be taking time to check-in on neighbors and thank those on the front lines of this fight.

I hope you'll join us:"
"As Muslim families across America and around the world celebrate the beginning of Ramadan, @DrBiden and I want to extend our best wishes to all who are observing this holy month. Ramadan Mubarak."
Times of crisis often bring out our best. There are so many stories of good happening around the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Take a minute to read a few:
26 million people unemployed. That's not just a statistic  — every one is a life thrown into uncertainty. Every worker left wondering when they will next see a paycheck is part of this American crisis  —  and Donald Trump isn't doing enough for them.
"Unlike our current president, I will always choose science over fiction."
"Make no mistake: The climate crisis poses an existential threat to our future. But I know the American people have the spirit, power, and ingenuity to meet the challenge head-on. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish when we do it together."
"Workers, like grocery store cashiers, are on the front lines of this crisis risking their lives every day to combat COVID-19 and keep this country running. President Trump is refusing to do his job, but we've got to do ours. Learn more:   #ShopSmart"
Our planet cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump.
We have the power to change the future of our planet — and it starts at the ballot box this November.
"This #EarthDay, let’s recommit to doing everything in our power to combat climate change. That starts with voting Donald Trump out of the White House this November."
Stranger things have happened.
"Fifty years ago, #EarthDay began as a day of organizing that demonstrated the power of community action. This year, it’s also a reminder of everything that’s on the line if we do not get Donald Trump out of the White House."
"The climate emergency requires our urgent action. As president, I will:

- Ensure we achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050
- Rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to go further
- Make the largest-ever investment in clean energy"

"On #EarthDay, we're reminded that there is no more urgent crisis facing this nation, or the world, than the threat posed by climate change. We have to take drastic action before it’s too late — and that’s exactly what I will do as president."
"Folks, we just launched a special #EarthDay episode of Here's the Deal! Governor @JayInslee joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, climate change, and why he's supporting our campaign.

Listen to the full episode now:"
"The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.

As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It’s unacceptable.

We can’t safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can’t effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job."
"The Paycheck Protection Program was intended to send help to the small businesses that needed it most, but President Trump adopted an approach to help his high-priced friends. We've got to do better.

Here's what I would do if I were president:"
"The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We need to immediately expand vote-by-mail, online voter registration, and early voting to ensure everyone can safely exercise their right to participate in our electoral process."
"I know COVID-19 is causing many people to feel anxious about what the future holds or lonely during this time of social distancing — and that's okay, just know that you're not alone. I've asked my friend, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to share a few tips on how to get through this:"
"This Holocaust Remembrance Day, as we remember the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime, we recommit to ensuring such atrocities never again occur. With anti-Semitism on the rise, all of us must root out intolerance and give hate no safe harbor."
"Out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated."
"I am honored to have the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, a leading environmental advocacy organization. Climate change is an existential threat, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity facing our country and our world."
"In March alone, this campaign raised $46.7 million, with 70% from online donations. This virus has changed our campaign. But it hasn't changed the unwavering support we've gotten from all of you. Together, we're going to defeat Trump. Help keep us going:"
The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job.

"No kid should fear for their life at school & no parent should worry whether their kid will come home safe. Today, 21 years after the Columbine shooting, @fred_guttenberg will host a town hall with students on how we can end this epidemic. Tune in at 7 PM:"
The office of the presidency comes with the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Every great president throughout our history has met that duty with the leadership it demands. Donald Trump has not.
"Like many families, we have had to find new ways to stay connected while we're physically apart. We've been video chatting with our grandchildren a lot and decided to record one to share with you all. Take a look:"
"On #SOULSaturday, folks will be doing everything from sewing masks and hosting food drives to writing letters to first responders and making calls to check in on neighbors. We are all in this together–and I hope you'll join us by signing up to take action:"
"In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. We lend a hand to our neighbors and take care of those in need. It's who we are. In that spirit, and to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting S.O.U.L. of the Nation Saturday this weekend."

Donald Trump left our country unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime — and now we're paying the price.
Donald Trump says he’s a wartime president — it’s time for him to act like one.
"Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy."
"Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It’s always somebody else's fault — never his. It’s unbelievable.

We deserve better from our commander in chief."
"Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.

Experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved.

Trump failed to take swift action—and we're paying the price."

"The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in China's leaders instead. Now, we're all paying the price.

Let me explain how we got here:"
I know the American people will beat this. We’re brave and big-hearted. We’ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation — and we will again.
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover. We need to provide paid sick leave to everyone who needs it immediately.
"It's been a big week: President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Senator Warren all endorsed our campaign — and we need your help to keep this momentum going.

I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today:"
"Together, we will defeat Donald Trump."
"Today’s news that more than 22 million people filed unemployment claims over the last month is devastating. It’s clear more needs to be done to help hardworking Americans—so I’m calling for a bigger, bolder approach to keeping people on the job. Read more:"
"These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are.

COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together—not by targeting people of AAPI heritage."
Here's the simple truth: This nation has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now. We will overcome this.
"When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all."
"To combat COVID-19, we need a decisive public health response to curb its spread and a comprehensive economic response that delivers real relief to Americans.

I've released several plans outlining exactly what I would do if I were president. Take a look:"
"When somebody is President of the United States, the responsibility is total."
"So this week, we’re working through what ours will be. There are a few I know: compassion, kindness, humility, gratitude, and joy. But I want your help. Our supporters have been here from the start—and I want to know: what should be in our campaign’s code?"
"We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. And when he fights, we’ll fight harder. But we can’t do it without you."
"Mayor @PeteButtigieg’s campaign had a set of “rules of the road” that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it’s a good idea, and one I’d like @TeamJoe to adopt."
"In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, “Joey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.” I’m working on building one for our campaign, too."
"Managing an economic relief and recovery effort is hard, painstaking work. The devil is in the details. It’s all about follow-through.

I've done the work before, and I'll be ready to do it on day one as president."
"We are building the movement that will beat Donald Trump.

Join us:"

"Today’s news that more than 22 million people filed unemployment claims over the last month is devastating. It’s clear more needs to be done to help hardworking Americans—so I’m calling for a bigger, bolder approach to keeping people on the job. Read more:"
"These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are.

COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together—not by targeting people of AAPI heritage."
Here's the simple truth: This nation has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now. We will overcome this.
"When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all."
"To combat COVID-19, we need a decisive public health response to curb its spread and a comprehensive economic response that delivers real relief to Americans.

I've released several plans outlining exactly what I would do if I were president. Take a look:"
"When somebody is President of the United States, the responsibility is total."
"So this week, we’re working through what ours will be. There are a few I know: compassion, kindness, humility, gratitude, and joy. But I want your help. Our supporters have been here from the start—and I want to know: what should be in our campaign’s code?"
"We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. And when he fights, we’ll fight harder. But we can’t do it without you."
"Mayor @PeteButtigieg’s campaign had a set of “rules of the road” that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it’s a good idea, and one I’d like @TeamJoe to adopt."
"In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, “Joey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.” I’m working on building one for our campaign, too."
"Managing an economic relief and recovery effort is hard, painstaking work. The devil is in the details. It’s all about follow-through.

I've done the work before, and I'll be ready to do it on day one as president."
"We are building the movement that will beat Donald Trump.

Join us:"
Millions of folks are relying on the workers at the front lines of this crisis. I’ll be talking to a few of them for our virtual town hall. Tune in:
"This afternoon, I’ll be hosting a virtual town hall with a few workers on the front lines of this crisis. Tune in at 3:00 PM ET to watch live:"
"COVID-19 is amplifying so many inequities in our society. We have to ensure support gets to those who need it immediately, and then do the necessary work to rip out the structural racism that creates these inequalities."
The President’s vanity is preventing people from paying their bills.
"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I’m proud to have the fiercest of fighters, Senator @EWarren, on my side. With her help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump and create a government that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected. Let’s do this."
From my basement to your sneaker room. Tune in Thursday at 11 PM ET on @SHODesusAndMero to watch!
I want Donald Trump to look these folks in the eye and explain to them why they or their loved ones haven’t been able to get tested for COVID-19. We’ve got to do better.
Let’s do this.
"Millions of people are relying on the workers on the front lines of this crisis. Tomorrow, I’ll be joined by a few of them for a virtual town hall. 

Tune in tomorrow at 3PM ET:"
"You have great taste, @SpeakerPelosi."
"Stories like this showcase exactly who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We help out folks we've never met, lift each other up, and do our part to ensure we make it through.

We will overcome this, together."
"President Obama understands, as I do, that we will come through this crisis stronger. And then we’ll not only rebuild this nation — we will transform it."
"Barack — This endorsement means the world to Jill and me. We’re going to build on the progress we made together, and there’s no one I’d rather have standing by my side."
"Leadership is about never proclaiming power. It’s about collaboration, it’s about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. It’s about results.  

That’s who I am and the role I aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times."
I am not running for office to be King of America. I respect the Constitution. I’ve read the Constitution. I’ve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country’s governors — Democratic and Republican — are doing under these horrific circumstances.
"I want to congratulate @judgekarofsky on her hard-earned victory tonight. In the face of rampant voter suppression and GOP recklessness, the people of Wisconsin showed up and made their choice clear. I know Wisconsin will be a fairer, more just state with Jill on the court."
"I am grateful to have the support of so many Wisconsinites and proud of the courage and commitment folks showed during last week's primary — but it should never have come to that.

No one should ever have to choose between their health and our democracy."
It shouldn't take a global pandemic shutting down schools to end school shootings.
"For months, the Trump Administration was repeatedly warned about the threat COVID-19 posed to our nation. They ignored the experts, failed to take action, and now Americans are paying the price."
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. We need a president who actually listens to public health experts.
"To Bernie’s supporters: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. 

I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome on this campaign. You’re needed."
Unity.
I'm speaking now about our nation's economic response to COVID -- and I'll have a special guest with me. Tune in:

"Our U.S. Postal Service workers are at the front lines of this crisis. Millions of people are relying on them for things like medicine and other essentials.

And the President is trying to let them fail. Congress should do everything it can to prevent this."
Tune in at 2:00 PM today for remarks on the urgent and dire need for a full economic response to COVID-19 at  .
"For this episode of Here’s the Deal, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham joined me to discuss presidential leadership and what it should look like in times of crisis.

You can listen to the full episode at   or wherever you get your podcasts."
We're facing a crisis unlike any we've faced before — and I couldn't be prouder of how the American people are responding.
"To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you."
"As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes."
"Folks, we just released a special Sunday episode of Here’s the Deal! @RevDrBarber joined me for a discussion on faith and its intersection with some of the most pressing issues we face as a nation.

Listen at   or wherever you get your podcasts."
"This Easter, Jill and I wish all of you and your families a safe and joyful celebration, and we join our prayers with those of people from every faith for health, happiness, and a renewal of life in the year to come."
We are in the middle of a global pandemic — and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.
"This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together."
We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible. Workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately. There's no time to waste.
"We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable.

Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act immediately."
"Now more than ever, we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction."
President Trump needs to do everything in his power to expand the number of testing sites and surge the number of tests. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and finding a way out of this crisis.
"The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. There's nothing we can't do if we do it together."
No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately.
We need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic  —  including the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  —  with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president.
The folks on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes.
"La historia de los EE.UU. es la historia de gente común que hace cosas extraordinarias. Sé que unidos, y como una nación, nosotros somos más fuertes que este virus. Sé que superaremos esto y seremos más fuertes por ello, se lo prometo. No pierdan la fe."

"The health inequities being exposed by COVID-19 are unconscionable.

We can do better. We have to."
"Whether you supported Bernie or any other candidate throughout the primary, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. You're not just welcome — you're needed. And I will do everything I can to earn your vote this November."
"America’s story is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things given half a chance. This virus is tough. But together and as a nation — we're tougher.

I know we’ll get through this and we’ll be stronger for it, I promise you. Keep the faith."
The stakes in this election have never been higher. We have to come together and beat Donald Trump.
"This virus can hit anyone — regardless of race, economic status, or access to power — but it doesn’t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources.

We have to do better for all our people."
"The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. We need to take extraordinary steps to protect American families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole."
"This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims—on top of the millions already filed—is devastating. We have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there.

I'm announcing two new policies to help Americans get the relief they need:"
"I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests — not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis."
"We have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. So today, I'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. As president, I will:

- Lower Medicare eligibility to age 60
- Forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families"
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.
"Eleven-year-old Isaac Johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. My advice was simple:

- Stay a safe distance from friends
- Sneeze into your elbow
- And eat your vegetables"
"A total of about 17 million people have filed for unemployment over the last three weeks. This is unprecedented. 

The economic devastation that families all across this country are experiencing is not their fault. We've got to take extraordinary steps to protect them."
We're seeing the soul of our nation on full display every day in this crisis — and it makes me so proud to be an American.
"If we come together, we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it."
This nation has never been defeated when we’re together. And we’re not going to be defeated now.
Join our virtual town hall on unemployment and the issues currently facing working families across the nation. Tune in now:
"The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but the slow and chaotic response to it is. He's the commander in chief — it's time he steps up, takes responsibility, and does his job."
"The primary is over, but we're just getting started. We're building a campaign to defeat Donald Trump and ensure that America finally lives up to our founding promises — but we can't do it without your help.

If you're with us, chip in today:"
"In the wake of COVID-19, working families across the country are facing a whole new set of challenges. This afternoon, I'll be hosting a town hall to listen to folks' concerns and discuss what we should be doing to deliver relief.

Tune in at 5:30 PM ET:"
Together we will defeat Donald Trump. But we will also address the climate crisis. We will make college affordable. And we will make health care available to all.  We will not just rebuild this nation – we’ll transform it. And I’m asking you to join me.

"To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future."
"I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to."

It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need. Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act to deliver these life-saving supplies.
We’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color & low-income communities—is linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is.
"The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again."
"Folks, I know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter — and what a difference it makes who is in the White House. If you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. I would really appreciate it."

Listen at   or wherever you get your podcasts."
"It is close to criminal the way they’re dealing with Captain Crozier. He spoke up to protect his sailors — he should have a commendation, not be fired."
"During our Family Town Hall on COVID-19, I was asked what we can do to prevent this from happening again. Here’s where I'd start:"
"During these uncertain times, getting the right information out there is so important.

Myself and @DrBiden had the opportunity to host a conversation about COVID-19 with 3 family vloggers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in now:"
These health care workers — and all those on the front lines of this fight — are American heroes.
Every day that Donald Trump refuses to use the full power of the Defense Production Act further threatens American lives.
"We all want to protect our families — the first step is arming ourselves with the facts.
 
@DrBiden and I hosted a town hall on COVID-19 with three family YouTubers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in tonight at 7PM EDT:"
"We are at war with this virus — and the health care workers on the front lines are our soldiers. It is unacceptable that they don’t have the lifesaving masks, gowns, and protective gear they need."
"Out of every crisis, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated."
"Donald Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately. This is no time to put pettiness and ideology above helping those who are in the greatest need.

Lives are at stake."
"Jill and I had the pleasure of hosting a town hall with family vloggers ItsJudysLife, The Curly Coopers, and JHouse Vlogs where we answered their questions about the COVID-19 outbreak.

Tune in to the premiere on Sunday at 7PM ET:"
"Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it."
"We owe so much to those working around the clock to keep our country running during this crisis. The least we can do is provide the pay, benefits, and protections they need and deserve."
"We need a Supply Commander to step up and take charge and get the doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, firefighters, and cops the equipment they need to protect themselves and save lives."
"In January, while Donald Trump was downplaying COVID-19, I wrote an op-ed calling for immediate action to combat the growing threat.

In it, I also said Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis.

I stand by that statement."
"Throughout the campaign, I’ve talked a lot about the soul of our nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. There’s so much good happening — people reaching out to one another, neighbors helping neighbors, caring for those in need. It makes me so proud to be an American."
"My friend, @GabbyGiffords, knows what it takes to persevere in the face of uncertainty. Take a few minutes to read these powerful words from her on how we can get through this — together."
"This is a headline every American should see: “Trump administration ended pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses”

Donald Trump’s shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared to deal with this outbreak."
"Those are the kinds of questions Trump will be responsible for. He doesn’t have a great record when it comes to delivering on promises, but I hope this time is different.
 
Being president is about taking responsibility. The blame game won’t cut it. Too many lives are at stake."
"The CARES Act provides money to help working people—how do we make sure it gets to them as quickly as possible?
 
There’s money for major corporations—how do we make sure that there is rigorous oversight to ensure it is used to help workers and not enrich top executives?"
"I’ve done this work before. It’s hard, painstaking work.
 
I was in charge of administering the $800 billion Recovery Act — so I understand that the devil is in the details. It’s about follow-through."
"It is close to criminal the way they’re dealing with Captain Crozier. He spoke up to protect his sailors — he should have a commendation, not be fired."

"Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors."
"This is another clear warning sign that more needs to be done to keep as many people on payroll as possible. Fast, bold action to bolster American workers now will save more pain later. Congress must get to work immediately on the next package. We can't afford to waste time."
"Now more than ever, we need to choose hope over fear. We will beat COVID-19. We will overcome this. Together."
Wisconsin — you have until 5 PM CT tonight to request your mail-in absentee ballot ahead of next week’s primary. Head to   to request yours today.
The evidence is clear: Donald Trump ignored the warnings. He failed to act. And now Americans are paying the price.
Real courage is confronting something that you're afraid to do and doing it anyway. That’s what people across this country are doing every single day in the face of this crisis. They are American heroes.
"In order for our government to work for all Americans, it's important it be representative of all Americans. With openly LGBTQ individuals only making up .17% of elected officials, we have work to do.

This National #OutToWin Day, I'm asking: Will you run?"
I'm about to roll out my plan to make the economic recovery work. Tune in now:
"My heart goes out to the millions of Americans who filed unemployment claims in recent weeks, and the millions more who worry what next week holds for them.

Donald Trump needs to take action to ensure Americans receive the economic relief they need as soon as possible."
"I know many folks are feeling anxious and worried. I just want you to know that you're not alone. Americans in every corner of the country are feeling the same exact way you are. We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together — and we will overcome this. I promise."
"Our health care workers on the front lines of this fight still don’t have the masks, gowns, and other protective equipment they need. It’s unacceptable.

Add your name to demand Donald Trump use his full authority to deliver these lifesaving supplies:"
The economic damage from this public health crisis is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate. It is putting working families and the American middle class through unimaginable financial pain — and they need to be made whole as fast as possible.
"It's now April, and:

- States still don't have enough tests
- Hospitals still don't have enough ventilators
- Health care workers still don't have enough masks

Donald Trump needs to use all available authorities immediately to solve these shortages."
"At a time when Americans might need health care the most, the Trump Administration is preventing people who need insurance from getting it. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds."
"Amigos, ¡es el Día del Censo! Solo toma unos minutos completar el Censo, pero ayudará a determinar el futuro de su comunidad para la próxima década. Visite   para que lo cuenten hoy."
This callous decision will cost lives. Period.
"Folks, it’s Census Day! The Census only takes a few minutes to complete but will help determine the future of your community for the next decade. Head to   to get counted today."
It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need.

"Thank you to the governors who are meeting this moment with decisive action, a steady hand, and compassionate leadership. Thank you for stepping up when President Trump has not."
The words of a president matter.
"We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is preventing people from getting health care.

I can’t believe this needs to be said, but President Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment, and he needs to do it now. Lives are at stake."
"Hoy, al honrar la vida y el legado del activista César Chávez, también agradecemos a los más de 2 millones de trabajadores agrícolas que están en primera línea, trabajando para mantener a los estadounidenses alimentados y sanos durante esta pandemia."
"Today as we honor the life and legacy of civil rights and labor movement activist, César Chávez, we also thank the more than 2 million farmworkers who are on the frontlines, working to keep Americans fed and healthy during this pandemic."
"Tonight marks our biggest public end-of-quarter deadline of the campaign so far. I know times are tough, but what’s at stake in this election has never been clearer. If you could chip in to help us reach our goal, I would really appreciate it:"
It's 2020 — it’s unacceptable that women still don’t get equal pay for equal work. Let’s close the gender pay gap and end #EqualPayDay once and for all.
"In the midst of a pandemic, the Trump Administration chose to expend effort to attempt to disestablish the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe’s reservation. #IStandwithMashpee and with all of Indian Country."
"Today and every day, @DrBiden and I are proud to stand with the trans community. We see you, we support you, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure you are affirmed and accepted just as you are. #TransDayOfVisibility"
"As president, I would never send an American soldier anywhere in the world without the equipment and protection they need. We should not do any less for the heroes on the front lines of the battle we’re in now."
I'm confident that the American people will meet this moment. There’s never been a challenge we've been unable to overcome if we do it together.
We have to place a temporary ban on evictions nationwide. No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic.
"In order to combat COVID-19, we need both a decisive public health response and a decisive economic response. I’ve laid out exactly what I would do if I were president during this crisis, take a look:"
"Our health care workers are putting their lives on the line every day, and our president is accusing them of stealing lifesaving supplies. It's time for Donald Trump to do his job, so our heroes are able to do theirs. Lives are at stake."
This is unconscionable. Americans are already afraid of the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is having on their lives — they don't need the added stress of losing their health insurance. Drop the lawsuit.
"I know these are confusing and scary times, so for the first episode of our new podcast I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, to help provide some clarity around COVID-19.

Listen at   or wherever you get your podcasts."
"The medical professionals on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes — risking their lives in order to save others. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. #NationalDoctorsDay"
"President Trump should be using the Defense Production Act to get our first responders and health care providers the masks, gowns, and protective equipment they need. This is a matter of life and death."
"The American people are generous, decent, good, and fair. In times of crisis, we come together as one. We look out for our neighbors and lend a hand to those in need. We will get through this, together. I promise."
"Not a joke, folks, we just launched our new podcast. It’s called ""Here's the Deal."" For our first episode, I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, for a discussion on COVID-19.

"I am issuing this challenge to the President: in the next 48 hours, direct the production and distribution of respirator masks, gloves, protective face shields and gowns to fill every supply request made by a governor to the federal government. 

Lives are at stake."
We will overcome this — together.
"As president, I will always choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction."
It's hard to read this story and not conclude one thing: The Trump Administration failed the American people.
Instacart needs to step up and give their workers the protections and pay they need and deserve. Now.
"Dreamers are Americans. We should never endanger or throw into question their ability to contribute to our nation, but to do so in a moment of national crisis is beyond misguided."
"The folks working to keep our country running are true heroes — and we need to ensure they have the protections, accommodations, and benefits they need and deserve. We couldn't get through this without them."
Donald Trump’s ego will cost lives.
"Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, but it’s even harder when you’re not able to be with them in their final moments — and that’s what’s happening around the country because of the coronavirus. It’s heartbreaking, and I’m keeping everyone affected in my prayers."
"The Administration promised millions of tests by mid-March. But it's not happening fast enough. Where are the tests, Mr. President?"
"Mr. President, this isn’t about you, it’s about the health of the American people. Stop making everything personal.

You are the president of all 50 states — not just the ones that voted for you or that have governors who “treat you right.” It’s time you acted like it."
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment.
"Last night, the great Rev. Joseph E. Lowery passed away, leaving an indelible mark on our country's history towards progress. He never once wavered in his spirit and in the resolve to end injustice — wherever he saw it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family."
"I just wrapped up tonight’s CNN town hall, where we discussed COVID-19 and how we move forward. I know times are tough, but the stakes in this election have never been higher. If you could chip in a few dollars I would really appreciate it."
You can't deal with the economic crisis until you deal with the public health crisis. It's a false choice.
"In response to the economic impact of COVID-19, we need to provide immediate relief to those who are drowning in student debt."
Join me and the hardworking folks on the frontlines of the COVID-19 outbreak for a virtual round table. Tune in now:
"This afternoon, I’ll be sitting down for a conversation with nurses, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. Tune in at 4:15 ET to join us:"
"Patients need ventilators.

Nurses need equipment.

And Donald Trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it. 

I thank God every day for people like @GovWhitmer, who are doing the work he won’t."
"The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.

He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."

It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."
"It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.

Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price."
"The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:

- Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person
- Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it
- Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine"
"The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American."
"President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered."
"Thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight. Your hard work is what makes America run every single day — but especially in times of crisis. We truly couldn't get through this without you."
The Trump Administration misled the American people.
"We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street.

It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.

If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen."
"If I were President, here's what I would do right now:

- Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic
- Launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it
- Bring leaders of Congress together to build the next deal"
"Live from our homes to yours. Looking forward to tonight, @JimmyKimmel."
"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we’re seeing Donald Trump do every day."
"Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge — together."
"The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work:"
"""If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June.""

Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives."
"In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.

Trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most."
"Alright @TeamJoe, join us for Happy Hour. Watch our virtual round table on the issues that matter to young folks:"
We will not allow this pandemic to rob our young people of the futures and the economic opportunities they have been working to build.
Dr. Fauci should be on TV a lot more than President Trump.
"Alright, folks. We're doing a happy hour tonight and you're invited. Join us at 6:30 PM ET at  ."
I'm about to deliver remarks on the impact of the Coronavirus on Young Americans. Tune in to watch live:
"The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done."
"It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.

Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price."
"The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:

- Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person
- Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it
- Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine"
"The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American."
"President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered."
"Thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight. Your hard work is what makes America run every single day — but especially in times of crisis. We truly couldn't get through this without you."
The Trump Administration misled the American people.
"We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street.

It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.

If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen."
"If I were President, here's what I would do right now:

- Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic
- Launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it
- Bring leaders of Congress together to build the next deal"
"Live from our homes to yours. Looking forward to tonight, @JimmyKimmel."
"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we’re seeing Donald Trump do every day."
"Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge — together."
"The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work:"
"""If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June.""

Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives."
"In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.

Trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most."
"Alright @TeamJoe, join us for Happy Hour. Watch our virtual round table on the issues that matter to young folks:"

The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
"Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.

No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow."
"President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price."
"As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now."
President Trump should stop attacking our nation's governors on Twitter and start delivering them the life-saving supplies they need.
Let me be clear: Donald Trump knew about the threat the coronavirus posed and failed to act. It’s one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.
The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
It has been a month since this tweet.
"I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together."
"As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.

No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives."
"In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”

In February, he said it would disappear.

Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”

Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price."
"Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.

We will overcome this, together."
"Where are the tests?
Where are the masks?
Where are the ventilators?

The American people deserve answers, Mr. President."
"Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need."
"A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their CEOs.

It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first."
"During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care."
"What is President Trump waiting for? 

Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.

Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe.

He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it."
I'm about to deliver remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic. Tune in to watch live:
"President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check."
"It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check."
The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.

President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.
"In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right."
"We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now."
"Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again."
"On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.

We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period."
"No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs."
"No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks."
It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families.
"We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing."
"Mr. President — stop lying and start acting. Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go."
"In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.

Donald Trump is incapable of doing that."
"We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It’s time for him to step up and do his job."
Donald Trump has failed the American people.
"Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us:"
"The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.

The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.

Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.

We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs."
"From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise."
The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
"Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns."
"In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus."
"If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that’s how we’ll get through this — together."

"The President says no one cares about being tested.

Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested?"
"Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That’s terrible economics & terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most."
The lack of coronavirus testing in the U.S. is a national disgrace.
"The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections."
"Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices."
"I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees."
".@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support."
"The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis."
This administration is truly morally bankrupt.
Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same.
My prayers go out to all those on the front lines of this crisis.
"Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?"
"Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words."
.@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.
"This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.

When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together."
"The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.

Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price."
Our campaign is building the broad coalition we need to win in November.
"I give you my word as a Biden: When I'm president, I will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth."
It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
"We need comprehensive action to combat the coronavirus outbreak. That's why I'm calling for a decisive public health response to curb its spread and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief."
"The President says no one cares about being tested.

Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested?"

I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.
Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job.
"Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink — and so many lives at stake — it’s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions — or inaction."
"In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. That's who we are.

We can and will meet this challenge — together."
"The next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges — like future pandemics.

We need a leader who will be ready on day one."
"Thank you, Arizona!"
"Thank you to everyone in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois who supported our campaign. From day one, our goal has been to unify our party and our nation — and tonight, we are one step closer to achieving that goal. Let’s do this, together."
I'm about to address tonight's election results from Delaware. Tune in to watch live:
"Thank you, Illinois!"
"Thank you, Florida!"
"This moment demands that we choose:

"Michigan’s response has far outpaced the federal government’s in this crisis. Gov. Whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news.

We need a president who will do their job and lead this country."

"Coronavirus is bigger than any one of us. Please take care of yourself, wash your hands, and practice social distancing. We will get through this — together."
"If I win the nomination, my pick for vice president will be a woman. If I win the presidency and have the opportunity, I will name the first black woman ever to the Supreme Court.

A Biden administration will reflect the country we are proud to work for."
"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump threatens everything we stand for, he has:

- Fanned the flames of hate
- Embraced white supremacists
- Separated families at the border
- Threatened our democracy

We have to get him out of the White House."
The coronavirus pandemic is bigger than any one individual. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the country and around the world — to solve this crisis.

"Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits."
We need a president who will always choose science over fiction.

"The coronavirus pandemic is like a war. And in a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people. #DemDebate"
"We need a comprehensive response to the coronavirus outbreak. My plan mounts a decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief."
Xenophobia is a disease. #DemDebate
"We have to treat climate change like the existential threat it is. As president, I will:

- End subsidies for fossil fuel corporations
- Ban new drilling on federal lands & waters
- Hold oil executives accountable
- Rally the world to raise the commitments of the Paris Agreement"

We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures."
I took on Paul Ryan's cuts to Medicare and Social Security — to his face. #DemDebate
People need help now. Not four years from now. Not eight years from now. We need a health care plan that can pass. #DemDebate
"Senator @BernieSanders' attacks on my record on Social Security are a bunch of malarkey — and @PolitiFact agrees.

We should be focused on going after Donald Trump — not fellow Democrats. #DemDebate"
"In the wake of the coronavirus, we need a major bailout package that delivers real relief to the American people — not more handouts for giant corporations."
"Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits."
We need a president who will always choose science over fiction.

Barack Obama was one hell of a president.
"""Thanks to a man of great position and character taking an interest in him, he knows that his stutter does not define him, nor his plans for a bright future.""

You raised an incredible young man, Elisa. I'm honored to have been a part of his journey."
Donald Trump is determined to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we’ve made. We can’t let him get away with it. We have to protect and build on the law to ensure every American has access to the health care they deserve.
"I have a message for the @NRA and gun manufacturers: If I am elected president, I am going to take you on and I will defeat you."
"With nearly 2 million Dominicans and their families in the U.S., we have so much to celebrate on Dominican Republic Independence Day! The everyday contributions of Dominican Americans to our country has enriched our lives and made us stronger."
"One year later, @senatemajldr is still stonewalling the bipartisan universal background check bill. It’s unbelievable. It’s time for Mitch McConnell to stand up to the @NRA, do his job, and bring the bill up for a vote. Lives depend on it."
"Folks, thanks to you we raised $1.2M from nearly 30,000 donors yesterday. And I was even happier to hear that 1/3rd of those donors were new. I can't begin to tell you what your support means. South Carolina is just a few days away, let's keep it going:"
Senator Sanders still hasn’t been honest about how much Medicare for All will cost and who will pay for it. The American people deserve the truth.
"A $15 an hour minimum wage is long overdue, but it’s just the start. We have to make sure every single worker receives the pay and dignity they deserve."
I don’t take the support of the African-American community for granted. I’ve worked like the devil to earn it and will continue to work for every last vote.
"Folks, we are currently $45,000 short of raising $1 million online today. We don't have a lot of time, but if we all pitch in, we can do it. Can I count on your help? Pitch in before midnight:"
"My faith is important to me because it gives me some reason to have hope and purpose. It took a long time for me to realize, but that purpose is the thing that has saved me."
"If I were president today, I would not be taking China's word when it comes to the coronavirus. American scientists and health experts should be allowed in the country to determine how the virus started and to help contain its spread."
Wrong Veep
"America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — but we’ve never stopped trying. We can’t rest until we reach our highest ideals and justice truly rings out for all."
"Tomorrow is the South Carolina primary, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line. If you have a few extra minutes, head to   to talk with folks before they head to the polls."
"My dad always said, “Champ, when you get knocked down, you get back up.” I’ve been knocked down a lot in my life, like so many Americans have, but always get back up. That’s the resiliency of the American people. Given half a fighting chance, there’s nothing we can’t do."
Senator Kaine is an incredible public servant. Virginians are lucky to have him representing them in the Senate — and I'm honored to have his endorsement.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. We have to get him out of the White House.

"I taught constitutional law for a long time and here's the deal: No amendment is absolute. There are limits.

Common-sense reforms like background checks and a ban on assault weapons are not a violation of the Second Amendment. Period."
I’m heartbroken at the news of yet another mass shooting in America — and I’m keeping the victims and their loved ones in my prayers. We can’t go on like this any longer as a nation. It’s time we come together and pass common-sense reforms to end this epidemic.
"I'm glad this bill — overdue now for more than a century — has passed.

Congress' failure to act on lynching will forever be a stain on the institution, but living up to the founding principles of our nation means fully coming to terms with the sins of our past."
"In 1994, I took on the @NRA to pass a 10-year ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The ban saved lives — and Republicans should have never let it expire.

As president, I’ll ban them once again. We will get these weapons of war out of our communities."
"I’m a union guy and always have been. I stand with @UFCW — and as president, I’ll invest in American workers.

We need to protect good American jobs and make sure our economy works for all Americans."
The evidence is clear: we can’t wait to take action on climate change. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on. The survival of our planet depends on it.
We need policies that allow Black Americans to create wealth. And we need policies that will let them pass it down from generation to generation.
We need to put a black woman on the Supreme Court.
"I know that with folks like Bernice and the Reckoning Crew, we will win the battle for the soul of our nation. I'm so grateful to have them on our team.

Join them and get involved in your community:"
Jim Clyburn is a voice of powerful moral clarity that is heard loud and clear across this country — in our capital and beyond. He reminds us why we’re in public service in the first place — and I’m proud to have his support.
"Team, we had a great debate tonight in South Carolina. I could use your help to keep this momentum going as we head toward the primary this Saturday. 

With just a few days left - chip in what you can, every dollar makes adifference:"
Being a progressive means actually making progress. I’m the only one in this race who has beaten the NRA nationally and passed real gun safety reform — and I’ll do it again as president. #DemDebate

"Tom Steyer invested $90 million in the nation's largest private prison company — a company that allegedly hog-tied and beat kids in South Carolina. It's despicable.

"Ban assault weapons.

Enact universal background checks.

Hold gun manufacturers accountable.

End our gun violence epidemic."
"In 2005, I voted to allow Americans to hold gun manufacturers accountable for the death and terror they've caused in our country. 

Bernie Sanders voted to let them off the hook."
This moment requires strong American leadership and disciplined diplomacy to lead a global response grounded in science — Donald Trump is incapable of that. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.
"With Donald Trump out of the way, there’s no limit to what America can achieve."
The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We should be making voting easier — not harder.
"This election is about more than just beating Donald Trump. It’s about:

- Replacing Betsy DeVos with an actual educator
- Having an Attorney General who defends the Constitution, not the president

"America’s story is full of barrier breakers who refused to accept the status quo — Katherine Johnson is among the finest. No hindrance — not racism, sexism, or even the force of gravity — was too tall a task for her. @DrBiden and I are keeping her loved ones in our hearts."
"Vanessa, I'm keeping you in my prayers today. Grief is a heavy burden to bear — especially with the eyes of the world watching. But there will come a day, I promise you, when the memory of Kobe and Gianna will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye."

Donald Trump is the most corrupt president we’ve ever had — and the American people deserve to know what he’s hiding in his tax returns.
"We’re not just trying to beat Donald Trump. We’ve got to take back the Senate, keep the House of Representatives, and unite our party."
"Over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions live in fear that their health care will be taken away from them. 

I promise you I will not let that happen — we will protect and build on Obamacare."
We need a president who will always choose compassion over cruelty.
"Americans aren’t looking for a handout. They’re just looking for a fair shot to get ahead. But too many people today aren’t getting that chance.

We have to rebuild the middle class — and this time, bring everyone along."

"Thank you to all of our incredible volunteers in Nevada for all your hard work — your faith in our campaign means the world to me.

We’re taking this campaign across the country and need your help. Head to   to get involved today."
Do you believe in life after Trump?
"It’s Caucus Day, Nevada! It’s time for the West to make its voice heard. Head to   to confirm your caucus location and make a plan to be there by 11:00 AM PT. Let’s win this!"
"For too many people across the country, the daily scourge of gun violence has turned normal into a living nightmare. It has to end. I’ve taken on the @NRA and won — twice. And I’ll do it again as president to end our gun violence epidemic."
"Today’s the day, Nevada! Confirm your caucus location at   and make a plan to arrive by 11:00 AM PT."
"The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 was our best shot at fixing our broken immigration system. It had bipartisan support and would have put millions of immigrants on the pathway to citizenship.

Bernie Sanders voted against it."
Donald Trump and Stephen Miller have raised the standard of cruelty with their inhumane immigration policies. We have to get them out of the White House and ensure our laws reflect our values as a nation of immigrants.
"Tomorrow is Caucus Day in Nevada, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line. I know we’ve asked a lot lately, but if you have a few extra minutes, please head to   to talk with caucusgoers about what’s at stake. I'd greatly appreciate it."

We all have a responsibility to declare with conviction that hatred and bigotry and white supremacy have no place in America. We must give hate no safe harbor.
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. We need to get him out of the White House and restore honor and dignity to the presidency.
Americans — not Vladimir Putin — should decide our elections.

I’ve sat there and looked in the eyes of parents who lost their kids to gun violence. They want to be able to sue these gun manufacturers. We should let them.

"We have to take on the @NRA and pass real reform to end our gun violence epidemic. That starts with universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and holding gun manufacturers accountable.

I've beaten the gun lobby twice — and I'll do it again as president."
"We fall into the same pattern every time: a senseless act of violence occurs, politicians offer “thoughts and prayers,” and calls for reform fade away until the next tragedy inevitably occurs.

I’m sick and tired of saying “enough is enough.” We can’t go on like this any longer."
Last night’s debate took place blocks away from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history — where a lone gunman took 58 precious lives and injured hundreds of others. Yet there were zero questions about how we end our gun violence epidemic. It was unacceptable.
"It’s simple: If you like your private health insurance plan, you should be able to keep it. If you don’t like it, you should be able to choose a new public option.

That’s the choice my administration will give every American — and we’ll do it without raising middle class taxes."
"Trump thinks the media is the enemy of the people. He's dead wrong.

America’s commitment to free press, free speech, and free expression should never waver, and certainly not in the face of Chinese authoritarianism. We've got to stand up for these freedoms at home and abroad."
We are in a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet.
It's time to hold gun manufacturers accountable.
"Action can’t wait when it comes to gun safety reform, health care, and immigration. We need a leader with the proven ability to unite the country and get big things done."

"It’s simple: If you like your private health insurance plan, you should be able to keep it. If you don’t like it, you should be able to choose a new public option.

That’s the choice my administration will give every American — and we’ll do it without raising middle class taxes."
"Trump thinks the media is the enemy of the people. He's dead wrong.

America’s commitment to free press, free speech, and free expression should never waver, and certainly not in the face of Chinese authoritarianism. We've got to stand up for these freedoms at home and abroad."
We are in a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet.
It's time to hold gun manufacturers accountable.
"Action can’t wait when it comes to gun safety reform, health care, and immigration. We need a leader with the proven ability to unite the country and get big things done."
"I’m feeling good about what’s to come for our campaign in Nevada, South Carolina and beyond. I could use your help to keep this momentum going.

"Welcome to the debates, Mike. We have a lot to catch up on about Barack Obama’s record."
I know that these past few years have felt like a constant crisis. But this moment is more than a crisis — it’s also an extraordinary opportunity. It’s a chance for us to come back together as a nation to reassert the values that define us as Americans.
"Let's be clear: Weapons of war have no place in our communities.

Former Mayor Pete doesn’t think very highly of the Obama-Biden record. Let’s compare.
"I just wrapped up tonight's #DemDebate, and I need your help to keep this momentum going. Every donation makes a big difference. Chip in today:"
Lt. Col. Vindman is an American patriot. #DemDebate
"With just four days until New Hampshire voters head to the polls, there’s no time to waste. We need your help to keep the momentum going from tonight’s #DemDebate. Chip in $5 to help power our campaign through this crucial stretch:"
"Five.

That’s how many times Senator Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands.

I helped pass it.

We need a president who'll stand up to the @NRA — not stand with them against lifesaving gun safety measures."
"The United States must keep our commitments when we make them, otherwise we have no power to lead the world. The only way to not become the police of the world is to have allies that will join us in dealing with failed states and terrorism. #DemDebate"
"The New Hampshire primary is just one day away, and we need your help to talk with folks about what’s at stake in this election. Head to   to make calls into New Hampshire from wherever you are in the country."
I've always said you shouldn't let the barriers in life define you. Brayden sure as hell didn't let them define him. I'm proud to be a part of his story:
"With just one day until the New Hampshire primary, we’re hard at work making our final case to voters — and we need your help. Chip in today to help us deliver our closing argument to as many Granite Staters as possible:"
We need a president with the courage to stand up to the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety measures — not one with a long record of siding with the gun lobby.
Experience matters. The White House is no place for on-the-job training. We need a president who will be prepared to clean up Donald Trump’s mess on day one.
"I've lost a lot in my life, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand by and lose my country too. We have to beat Donald Trump."
"I know there are a lot of folks who want to write our campaign off already — but I’ve got news for them: We’re not going anywhere. There's too much at stake in this election.

I will fight for every last vote, but I can't do it without you. Chip in today:"
"There are just two days until the first-in-the-nation primary, and we need your help to bring us across the finish line. If you have a few minutes, head to   to talk with New Hampshire voters about what's at stake in this election. I’d greatly appreciate it."
"It’s not enough to just end Citizens United — we have to eliminate all private dollars from our federal elections.

It's time we return our democracy to the people."
We are in a climate emergency. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and treat climate change like the existential threat that it is — before it's too late.
Rebuilding the middle class and ensuring that this time everyone comes along starts with one word: unions. That’s why I look forward to signing the #PROAct as President. Congratulations to the House and labor movement for passing this landmark bill.
#TeamJoe has been hard at work talking with folks in every corner of New Hampshire — but it all comes down to this final push. Every conversation will make a big difference on Tuesday. Sign up to volunteer today:

We’re not only going to have to win the White House but we have to bring along the United States Senate. We can’t do that with someone who labels themselves as a Democratic Socialist. #DemDebate
I’m incredibly proud of Brayden for sharing his story on national TV. He is truly a remarkable young man — and I can’t wait to see what his future holds.
No corporation pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than our teachers and firefighters. It’s time corporations pay their fair share.

"We're just four days from the first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire, and we need all hands on deck to talk with voters before they head to the polls. Head to   to make calls to New Hampshire voters from wherever you are in the country."
"When I met Brayden this week, he had a familiar anxiety on his face. It was the anxiety of a kid with a stutter, something I struggled to overcome when I was a kid too. Here's what I told him."
We need a president who chooses compassion over cruelty.
It’s not hyperbole to say that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Everything that makes us who we are is at stake. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take back this country.
Empathy matters. Compassion matters. We have to reach out to one another and heal this country — and that’s what I’ll do as president.
"John DiEleuterio had a huge heart and was a friend I counted on for over 50 years. As a Colonel in the National Guard and as the State Director in my Senate office, John served our country with dignity and distinction. Jill and I send our condolences to Maureen and his family."

"Mayor Pete likes to call me part of the old failed Washington. Was it a failure when I helped pass Obamacare, the Paris Agreement, the Violence Against Women Act, or the assault weapons ban?

I have a stronger record of passing big, progressive legislation than anyone running."

We have to get him out of the White House."
Ending gun violence is on the ballot. We have to take on the powerful gun lobby and pass common-sense measures that will keep our kids safe. I've beaten the @NRA twice — and I'll do it again as president.

"From my childhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the halls of the White House — the middle-class values of hard work, respect, and decency have guided my entire life. It's time we brought those values back to the Oval Office."
"The Iowa Caucus is just days away and polls show us in a dead heat. I'm confident that we can compete and that we'll go on to beat Donald Trump—but we need your help to do it.

Every dollar makes a big difference—chip in to bring us across the finish line:"
America's farmers deserve better than four more years of Donald Trump's empty rhetoric and broken promises.
"We have to restore the soul of this nation, build an inclusive middle class, and unite the country to get big things done. That all starts Monday night in Iowa. If you’re with me, let me know by committing to caucus today:"
"With just three days until Iowa, we need all hands on deck to talk with folks about what’s at stake in this election. Every conversation during this final stretch will make a big difference on Monday night. Sign up to volunteer today:"
"America's character is on the ballot. We can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but if given eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can't let that happen."
"Donald Trump's Muslim ban is a direct betrayal of America’s most fundamental freedom: religious freedom. And now he's adding more countries to his list of who's not welcome in America.

It's not who we are — and we'll prove that when we beat Trump this November and end the ban."
"I've stood up to bullies my entire life, and I'm ready to stand up to the one in the White House. I hope President Trump heard that message loud and clear when he saw this ad air during Fox & Friends this morning."
"Time and time again, Donald Trump has proven he has no moral rudder. Instead of having respect for others, he insults and demeans. He preys on divisions and stokes hate, instead of healing and uniting.

Trump is everything we aspire not to be as Americans."
.@JohnDelaney ran his campaign with conviction to make our government work for the American people. He will continue to be an important voice in shaping our country for years to come.
"Let's be clear: If Donald Trump can afford to give giant tax breaks to the super-wealthy, then he can afford to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society receive the health care they need and deserve.

We should be expanding Medicaid — not cutting it."
"Airline catering workers will feed thousands of people traveling to the Super Bowl, but can’t afford to feed their own families. I stand in solidarity with @unitehere_sofla. @AmericanAir needs to ensure @LSGSkyChefs pay their workers living wages."
The character of a president matters — and we have to make that clear this November.
"Donald Trump is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. After four years of his self-made chaos, we'll need a president who is ready to clean up the mess on day one."
"With just four days until Iowa and one day until our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline — your support has never been more important. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way in this final stretch.

Chip in today to help fuel our campaign:"
We can't let Donald Trump define us as a nation — we are so much better than who he thinks we are. Let’s choose to be the more perfect union we've always aspired to be and restore the soul of this nation.
"In four days, Iowans will gather in every corner of the state to set our nation on the path to picking the next president. It's a big responsibility — and we need your help to talk with as many folks as possible about what's at stake. Take action today:"
"It’s no understatement to say that Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the future of our country. He has repeatedly shown little understanding of — and zero regard for — our laws, our values, or our democracy.

We have to get him out of the White House."
Ending gun violence is on the ballot. We have to take on the powerful gun lobby and pass common-sense measures that will keep our kids safe. I've beaten the @NRA twice — and I'll do it again as president.
"As I’ve said many times, health care is deeply personal to me, like it is for so many Americans. I’m proud to stand with @SEIU1199NW to fight for safe staffing, patient care, and fair pay."
The true character of a person is revealed in the Oval Office. We saw it with President Obama. We're seeing it with President Trump — and what we've witnessed from this president over the last three years makes clear that we can't give him another four.
"Donald Trump has slammed the door shut in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. On day one, I will eliminate President Trump’s decision to limit asylum and end the MPP program. #RestoreAsylumNOW"
"I've spent my entire life bringing people together to get big, difficult things done. And I intend to do that as your president — unifying our country at the moment we need it most. There’s no limit to what we could do if we come together."
Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue. That's why the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that the Obama-Biden Administration signed 11 years ago today. We have to continue the fight until we close the gender pay gap once and for all.
We need a president who respects religious freedom.
The decision to allow the Trump Administration to discriminate against immigrants based on wealth is a cruel betrayal of our values. The next four years could have a generational impact on our federal courts — we have to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
"I need your help if we're going to restore the soul of this nation. With the Iowa Caucuses just days away, your donation is more important than ever.

Chip in $5 to help fuel our campaign:"
"Climate is on the ballot. If we don’t get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action now to address the climate crisis, our planet may never recover."
Donald Trump’s demonstrated failures of judgment and his repeated rejection of science make him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge.
"Imagine all the progress we could make in the next four years. We could make health care a right, lead on climate change, and get assault weapons out of our schools. It could all be a reality — but first, we have to beat Donald Trump."
A peace plan requires two sides to come together. This is a political stunt that could spark unilateral moves to annex territory and set back peace even more. I've spent a lifetime working to advance the security & survival of a Jewish and democratic Israel. This is not the way.
"Iowans, on Feb. 3rd, you have a chance for a twofer. You can ruin Donald Trump's night, and you can ruin Senator Ernst’s, too."
Let's remember one thing when it comes to impeachment: Donald Trump is on trial because he's afraid to run against me. He knows I’ll beat him this November.
"Health care is personal to me. Deeply personal. And I guarantee you that if I'm elected president, I will protect your family's health care as if it were my own family’s."
"Iowa caucus-goers take note. Joni Ernst just spilled the beans. She and Donald Trump are scared to death I’ll be the nominee. On Feb. 3rd, let’s make their day."
"No family in search of a better life should be denied permanent residency because they don't meet Donald Trump's wealth test.

The United States of America should be open and welcome to all — not just the wealthy."
Let's be clear: Donald Trump's Muslim ban was never about safety — it was a blatant ploy to fan the flames of bigotry and score points with his political base. I will end it.
"With just one week until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to bring us across the finish line. Every door knocked, phone call made, or dollar chipped in goes a long way in this homestretch. Head to   to get involved."
"On #HolocaustMemorialDay and the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, we honor the millions of Jews and other victims whose lives were extinguished by the Nazi regime. Today and every day, we must give hate no safe harbor to ensure such atrocities never again occur."
"As I’ve said many times, health care is deeply personal to me, like it is for so many Americans. I’m proud to stand with @SEIU1199NW to fight for safe staffing, patient care, and fair pay."

"Selling off public services to private interests at the expense of workers and their communities should be a non-starter. Congratulations to the members of @ATUComm, who went on strike for 84 days to fight for their rights — and won."
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and we are running out of time to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and rally the world to meet the urgency of this moment.
"I'm grateful to have the endorsement of the @scj. The battle for the soul of this nation begins in Iowa — and I'm confident that together, we'll make Donald Trump a one-term president and take back this country."
"Congrats @MichelleObama on winning a Grammy for telling your story with strength — and with grace. Jill and I are so thrilled for you. Just beat Barack to an EGOT, will ya?"
Jill and I are sending our prayers to the Bryant family and to everyone who lost loved ones in today’s crash. It’s a reminder of how special — and fragile — life is. And it’s a reminder that we’ve got to make every day count.
"Make no mistake: Our best days still lie ahead. If we come together and act as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish."
"The seas are rising. Australia is burning. And in this moment of crisis, our President thinks windmills cause cancer. Solving the climate crisis, starts with beating Donald Trump. And once I do, we'll pass my ambitious climate plan."
"Firefighters represent the best of America — they put their lives on the line every single day and selflessly rush toward danger to save others.

I'm grateful for the endorsement of @IAFFNewsDesk. There's no group of people I'd rather stand with."
"Every American deserves access to safe, clean drinking water. We have to hold polluters accountable and rid our water of unsafe levels of these chemicals for good."
"Happy Lunar New Year to all those celebrating throughout the country. I'm grateful for the contributions that the AAPI community has made to enrich America's diversity. I hope the Year of the Rat brings good fortune, health, and happiness to all."
"One of my favorite parts of the campaign trail is meeting folks across the country and hearing their stories. So my team and I are picking one lucky person to sit down with me for a cup of joe.

Let’s be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights.
"After four years of Betsy DeVos and the Trump Administration, our students and educators will need strong advocates in the White House who will repair the damage they have caused. That's exactly what they'll have with me and @DrBiden."
"34 U.S. troops have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury after Iranian missiles struck their base in Iraq. Donald Trump brought us to the brink of war—then dismissed the injuries as “headaches.”

The idea that the commander in chief would take this lightly is disgusting."
"The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher. Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he poses a threat to America and the world. We have to beat him."
"Immigrants have always made our country stronger. Our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does."
"The next president will face the enormous task of picking up the pieces left by President Trump. They will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize the world to meet new challenges. There will be no time to lose."
"My Dad used to say, ""don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value."" Your 2020 budget cuts Social Security and Medicaid while protecting giveaways to the wealthiest. You've shown us what you value."
"Great news out of Utah. No child should be subjected to the vile, immoral practice of conversion therapy. We have to ban it at the federal level and make sure every young person is affirmed and accepted just as they are."
"I tell people that when a family experiences tragedy, the most important thing they can do is to turn their grief into purpose. @fred_guttenberg found his purpose — and his courage and determination have helped fuel the fight for gun safety reform."

It’s not hyperbole to say Donald Trump is a threat to our planet. We have to get him out of the White House and treat the climate emergency like the existential threat that it is. Our future depends on it.
"On the anniversary of a hopeful moment, it's clear Trump's Venezuela policy is a dead end. Millions are suffering with the Maduro regime still in power."

"When we divert public funds to private schools, we undermine the entire public education system. We've got to prioritize investing in our public schools, so every kid in America gets a fair shot. That's why I oppose vouchers. #Espinoza"
Empathy matters. I think it's important — not only for leaders — but for everybody to treat people with respect.
An administration that gives trillions in tax cuts to giant corporations and the super-wealthy but cuts food assistance for the most vulnerable in our society is morally bankrupt.
"47 years ago today, #RoevWade recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose — but that right is under attack across the country. We must codify Roe into law and fight back against any state laws that violate it."
"My administration will not cut Social Security or Medicare benefits. Period. We’ll expand them. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is saying he would consider sacrificing seniors' benefits to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and big companies. We have to defeat him in November."
Our students and educators deserve better than four more years of Betsy DeVos.

"We have to end Citizens United, but we can't stop there. It's time we eliminate all private dollars from federal elections and return our democracy to the people."
I've been fighting to protect — and expand — Social Security for my whole career. Any suggestion otherwise is just flat-out wrong.

"Make no mistake, Obamacare is on the ballot this November. Coverage for millions of Americans and protections for pre-existing conditions are on the ballot.

We have to protect the progress we've made and show up to the polls to defend the Affordable Care Act."
"Ten years ago, the Supreme Court unleashed an unlimited flood of dark money into our politics with its Citizens United decision—further corrupting our politics & eroding faith in our democracy.

It’s time we end Citizens United. Add your name if you agree:"
I was reminded this weekend by Pastor McCallum that we've got to bring a sense of community back to this country. That work starts now.
"Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement. And in my administration, we won't just protect it. We'll expand it."

From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President — I've spent my entire career fighting against discrimination and championing civil rights. I'm running for president to bring that fight to the Oval Office and give everyone a full share of the American dream.
"In times of crisis and division, a president should seek to calm and heal. But time and again, President Trump has chosen to further stoke the flames.

He is poison to the soul of our nation."
"As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” As we seek to restore the soul of this nation from a long moral lapse, we look to those words and take solace that this too shall pass and justice will prevail. #MLKDay"
Honored to have won Jacquelyn's endorsement.
"Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics have brought America to an inflection point. In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to take the next great step forward as a nation.

Let's get to work. We can do this, together."
This is a big victory for South Carolina. The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is — we have to break down barriers to the ballot box and ensure every American can make their voice heard.
"The big banks didn't need an additional $32 billion in savings, and their shareholders certainly didn't need an extra $21.5 billion in payouts.

It's time we ensure corporations pay their fair share and that our country rewards work — not wealth."
"The 60th anniversary of our alliance with Japan reminds us that close partnership and deep cooperation are among our greatest assets. I understand the value of our alliances; they make us stronger. I would build on this legacy, rather than dismantling it."
"I stand with the snow plow drivers who work day in and day out to keep our roads safe, often in dangerous conditions. Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits. Stay safe out there, @IBT_320."
"Thank you @Captsully for sharing your story. There’s a lot of kids who I bet needed to hear it. 

Being different isn’t a barrier to success. It can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing — or even run for President."
"Donald Trump continues to embrace corruption at home and abroad. Rather than addressing the root causes pushing people to flee Central America, he has undermined anti-corruption bodies—first in Guatemala and now in Honduras."
"There used to be a basic bargain in this country—when you worked hard, you shared in the prosperity you helped create. But CEOs and Wall Street continue to put profits over workers. It's wrong.

We have to restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone earns what they deserve."
"Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country.

Chip in if you’re ready to leave him in the dust:"
Weapons of war have no place in our communities. It’s time we take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons for good.

"Happy birthday, @MichelleObama. You’re a shining light in the lives of all that have the honor of knowing you. Jill and I are grateful to call you a dear friend.

But don’t tell Jill — I’m still eating ice cream. And I’m not sorry."
We need a president who respects our troops — and who will restore honor and integrity to the Oval Office.
"Donald Trump says he prefers war heroes who ""weren't captured."" He attacks Gold Star families. Now he calls our generals “losers,"" “babies” and “dopes.""

He degrades the office he holds every day."
No malarkey here.
"Minnesota — early voting is now open! Don’t wait until March 3rd to cast your ballot, head to the polls and be one of the first in the nation to make your voice heard in the primary.

Find everything you need to know here:"

"I stand with the snow plow drivers who work day in and day out to keep our roads safe, often in dangerous conditions. Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits. Stay safe out there, @IBT_320."
"Thank you @Captsully for sharing your story. There’s a lot of kids who I bet needed to hear it. 

Being different isn’t a barrier to success. It can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing — or even run for President."
"Donald Trump continues to embrace corruption at home and abroad. Rather than addressing the root causes pushing people to flee Central America, he has undermined anti-corruption bodies—first in Guatemala and now in Honduras."
"There used to be a basic bargain in this country—when you worked hard, you shared in the prosperity you helped create. But CEOs and Wall Street continue to put profits over workers. It's wrong.

We have to restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone earns what they deserve."
"Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country.

Chip in if you’re ready to leave him in the dust:"
Weapons of war have no place in our communities. It’s time we take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons for good.
"Vermont — you don't have to wait until March 3rd to cast your ballot, you can early vote now! Head to   to find all the info you need to make your voice heard in the primary."
"Happy birthday, @MichelleObama. You’re a shining light in the lives of all that have the honor of knowing you. Jill and I are grateful to call you a dear friend.

But don’t tell Jill — I’m still eating ice cream. And I’m not sorry."
We need a president who respects our troops — and who will restore honor and integrity to the Oval Office.
"Donald Trump says he prefers war heroes who ""weren't captured."" He attacks Gold Star families. Now he calls our generals “losers,"" “babies” and “dopes.""

He degrades the office he holds every day."
No malarkey here.
"Minnesota — early voting is now open! Don’t wait until March 3rd to cast your ballot, head to the polls and be one of the first in the nation to make your voice heard in the primary.

Find everything you need to know here:"
"It is a moral failing when children are ripped from their parents' arms, locked away in overcrowded detention centers, and denied toothbrushes and soap.

We have to end Donald Trump's cruel policies and build a fair and humane immigration system."
"This isn't just about who I am, this is about who we are as a country. We're tough, resilient, but always full of hope. With every fiber in my being, I believe there’s not a single thing we can't do—if we do it together."
Hate never goes away; it just hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back.
"America’s farmers have had enough of your empty promises, Mr. President."
"Let's be clear: white supremacy, racism, and violence have no place in America. We have to root out these evils and give hate no safe harbor. If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of our nation."
Voting is a right.
A president has to be able to not only fight — but heal and bring our country together. I promise you that’s what I will do if I’m elected.
The character of our nation is on the ballot in this election. We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — and we have to prove that this November.
"If true, this constitutes an unprecedented attack on our Foreign Service. Amb. Yovanovitch spent her life advancing U.S. interests, only to be defamed by this administration. Our diplomats deserve better. It's inexcusable that Sec. Pompeo won't defend them."
"America has never lived up to our promise of equality for all, but we've never stopped trying. Virginia brought us closer to that highest ideal today by ratifying the long overdue #ERA.

Women's rights should be explicitly in our Constitution—not left to the whims of legislators."
"I'm more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we come together and unite this country, there's not a single thing we can't do."
"My thoughts and prayers are with Mustafa Kassem's family at this difficult time. His death, after six years in an Egyptian jail, is an outrage. Americans unjustly detained anywhere in the world deserve our government’s full support and relentless efforts to secure their release."
"This seems like a great reason to rejoin the Paris Agreement, @realDonaldTrump."
"I’m proud that today, our campaign is launching HBCU Students for Biden. This program will be dedicated to helping HBCU students throughout the country learn how to organize for our campaign. 

Sign up here:"
"I'm ready to debate Donald Trump on the economy. The American people are getting clobbered, and the wealthy are the only ones doing well. We have to rebuild the middle class, and this time, make sure everyone comes along."
"Cornell is right — everything is at stake this November. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and unite this country. Because if we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we can't accomplish."
"Historically Black Colleges and Universities have always been the heartbeat of our country’s fight for justice. That’s why I’ll invest $70 billion in HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions.

When HBCUs rise, we all rise—join HBCU Students for Biden today:"
"I just got off the debate stage in Iowa, where we're in the homestretch before the caucus. With just 19 days left, every dollar counts.

Chip in if you're ready to take back this country and make Donald Trump a one-term president:"
"This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, if we do it together. Let’s go do it. #DemDebate"
"With just 20 days until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to fuel our campaign. Every donation—big or small—goes a long way in this homestretch.

If you liked what you heard at tonight's #DemDebate, please chip in what you can to keep our momentum going:"

"Look, I’ve been the object of Donald Trump’s affection now more than anyone else on this stage. I’ve taken all the hits he’s delivered, and I’m only getting stronger in the polls. #DemDebate"
"Republicans have savaged my only surviving son. They’ve spread lies about me that networks won’t even carry. It doesn’t matter if they go after me.

As President of the United States, I have to be able to not only fight — I have to heal. And that’s what I’ll do if I’m elected."
Child care is personal to me: I was a single parent as a young senator. I commuted home to Delaware every night to tuck my kids into bed. Child care should be affordable for every parent. #DemDebate
"Make no mistake, the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed walking away from the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He failed on both accounts."
"Under the Biden administration, labor and environmental groups will be at the table to negotiate trade agreements. Period."
Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with drug companies. #DemDebate
"I’ve been very clear about what my health care plan would do: Build on Obamacare by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate. #DemDebate"
"If we don’t write the global rules of the road for trade, cyber, climate change, and so much more, they may be written by China or other nations that don’t share our values. #DemDebate"
"I wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong Un without pre-conditions. By meeting with him, Donald Trump gave Kim Jong Un what he was looking for: legitimacy. I will work closely with our allies and hold China accountable for its lack of pressure on the Kim regime’s bad behavior. #DemDebate"
No president can take our country to war without the informed consent of the American people. #DemDebate
There’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely – which I oppose and will end – and using small teams of special forces to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. #DemDebate
No one should shed a tear for Qassem Soleimani. But Trump’s reckless escalation and thoughtless withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has made America less safe. We need a return to diplomacy and a steady hand at the wheel to navigate an increasingly dangerous world. #DemDebate
"When Trump discarded the Iran nuclear deal he promised it would produce a “better” one and curb Iranian aggression—the reverse happened. Iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. I’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face."
In 2009 President Obama asked me to oversee our effort to bring home our combat troops. I’ll put my record and my judgment up against anyone in terms of who is the right person to be Commander in Chief. #DemDebate

So much of what’s tearing this country apart can be fixed if we treat each other with basic dignity and respect once again. That starts with having a president who leads by example.
"Donald Trump has once again sided with corporations over American workers by making it easier for them to get away with wage theft and overtime violations.

It's time we put workers' rights over corporate greed and ensure everyone has the workplace protections they deserve."
"We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has:

- Fanned the flames of hatred and bigotry
- Embraced dictators
- Ripped children from their parents' arms
- Degraded our national character

We have to get him out of the White House."
"Why are you so obsessed with me, Mr. President?"
"I'm married to a teacher, I see firsthand how difficult it is. We've got to let educators do their job so our students can succeed - that means paying them the salaries they deserve and giving them the respect that they've earned."

"From day one, Donald Trump has been determined to roll back every environmental protection he could get his hands on.

At a time when the climate crisis is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them."
"The stakes of this election could not be higher. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We can't let that happen.

We have to do everything in our power to make him a one-term president."
"When we said to give us your tired, poor, and huddled masses, we absolutely did not mean ""unless they are fleeing violence."""
"Transit workers are being attacked every day, often while buses are moving, putting bus drivers and riders in harm's way. That's why I strongly support the Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act to protect our workers from harm while doing their job."
"Donald Trump has no strategy when it comes to Iran. No endgame. The only way out of his self-made crisis is through diplomacy — clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upmanship."
"Come on. Your administration has been arguing in court to repeal protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

You're trying to take health care away from millions of people. The least you could do is be honest about it."
"Cory, you campaigned with joy and heart, and instead of just talking about bringing people together, you did it every day. You made our politics better just by running. Grateful to you and looking forward to your continued leadership."
Puerto Rico should not be treated any differently than if this happened anywhere else in America — it's wrong. We should be surging all the help that is needed to fix the damage done by the earthquakes.
"There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. We can:

- Address the climate emergency
- Build a more inclusive middle class
- Build on Obamacare
- Ensure our government works for everyone — not just the powerful"
"Trump’s reckless policies have needlessly endangered our interests in the Middle East. But none of us should be under any illusions about the Iranian regime, and the Iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. The world should support them."
"Gracias por su apoyo, Mayor @EricGarcetti. Estoy orgulloso de caminar junto a los bomberos, los Angelenos, y los Americanos. Y hoy, me siento orgulloso de caminar junto a ti. Vamos."
"Thank you for your endorsement, Mayor @EricGarcetti. I’m proud to walk with firefighters, Angelenos, and Americans. And today, I’m proud to walk with you. Let’s do this."
"I want to congratulate my friend Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller on making history. I've known Tom for years, he has never been afraid to take on the tough fights and has always served with honor and integrity—Iowa and our nation are better because of it."
I've seen firsthand how hard our educators work for little pay and with few resources. They deserve better. It's time we support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.
What kind of nation are we if we simply accept that kids learn active shooter drills with their ABCs? We have to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reforms to protect our children.
Congratulations to President Tsai and the people of Taiwan for another successful election. You are stronger because of your free and open society. The United States should continue strengthening our ties with Taiwan and other like-minded democracies.
Members of Teamsters Local 104 are striking against ASARCO for their unfair labor practices—I called into the picket line to support them. Every company should provide its workers with the pay and benefits they've earned—especially one that pulls in over $1 billion in profits.
"Firefighters represent the best of America — courageous, selfless, and always answering the call to duty. I'm grateful to those who are heading to help our friends in Australia battle devastating wildfires."
"Being a nation of immigrants is and has always been one of our greatest strengths. Our diversity has always made us stronger, but Donald Trump doesn’t get that."
"Make no mistake: the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump's own making. He brought us to the brink of war with no plan and no strategy.

"I've released 21 years of my tax returns. Why haven't you released any of yours, Mr. President?

Release your taxes or hush up about corruption."
"Donald Trump brought us dangerously close to starting a new war with Iran without any semblance of a plan.

This moment requires a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces and repair the damage Trump has caused."
"I started the Cancer Moonshot so we could be the generation that finally cures cancer.

You then tried to slash nearly $1 billion for cancer funding.

We're lucky that the cancer rate is down, but we're luckier that Congress stopped you."
This election is about the soul of America — and a nation that allows our epidemic of school shootings to continue has a troubled soul. We have to beat the @NRA and get weapons of war off our streets. Lives depend on it.
Facebook continues to put their profits over the truth — allowing politicians like Donald Trump to spend an unthinkable amount of money on paid disinformation. Our democracy is worse off for their failure to confront this.
"We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. We don’t have to give in to his dark, petty, angry vision of America. We can choose to be the more perfect union we have always aspired to be — and restore the soul of this nation."
"Instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on Iran, Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama-Biden record. He's been President for three years. It's time he stops blaming President Obama for his failures."
"I'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. But we're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next."
Gabby is one of the strongest people I know. The resilience she has shown is remarkable. I'm inspired by her courage in turning tragedy into purpose and grateful for her relentless determination to make our country a safer place for all.
"3,820 days — that's how long it's been since the federal minimum wage was last raised. It’s unacceptable. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide should be just our starting point for ensuring workers receive the pay they deserve."
"Pope Francis is absolutely right. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone has access to the care they need. Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few."
"We have to rebuild the middle class. But this time, we have to make sure that people historically left out of the middle class — whether due to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — have the chance to be included in our success."
"I’m going to hold off on commenting on the news tonight until we know more, but there is one thing I will say: Jill and I are keeping our troops and Americans overseas in our prayers. We hope you’ll keep them in yours."
"Donald Trump says he wants to end endless wars in the Middle East, yet he is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one."
"Estoy con el pueblo de Puerto Rico, nuestros conciudadanos, en este momento de necesidad. Es inconcebible que gran parte del arduo trabajo de la recuperación ante desastres aún no se haya hecho. Tenemos que ofrecer apoyo concreto a Puerto Rico antes de que se pierdan más vidas."
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow citizens, in this moment of need. It’s unconscionable that so much of the hard work of disaster recovery continues to be left undone. We've got to deliver concrete support for Puerto Rico now before more lives are lost."
"Nicolás Maduro is a dictator. I strongly condemn his regime’s violent takeover of the Venezuelan National Assembly, the country’s sole remaining democratic institution."
"Donald Trump is the most reckless & incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. Every day he directs American national security is a dangerous day for the world.

We have to get him out of the White House. Chip in to help make him a one-term president:"
"At 1:00 PM, I'll be speaking about the escalating situation with Iran and the imperative need to restore respected, responsible, and dignified leadership on the world stage. Tune in to watch live:"
"Trump wants to ignore climate science when making infrastructure decisions. In the Biden Administration, every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to reduce and withstand a changing climate."
"I've released 21 years of my tax returns. Why haven't you released any of yours, Mr. President?

"Donald Trump says he wants to end endless wars in the Middle East, yet he is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one."
"Estoy con el pueblo de Puerto Rico, nuestros conciudadanos, en este momento de necesidad. Es inconcebible que gran parte del arduo trabajo de la recuperación ante desastres aún no se haya hecho. Tenemos que ofrecer apoyo concreto a Puerto Rico antes de que se pierdan más vidas."
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow citizens, in this moment of need. It’s unconscionable that so much of the hard work of disaster recovery continues to be left undone. We've got to deliver concrete support for Puerto Rico now before more lives are lost."
"Nicolás Maduro is a dictator. I strongly condemn his regime’s violent takeover of the Venezuelan National Assembly, the country’s sole remaining democratic institution."
"Donald Trump is the most reckless & incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. Every day he directs American national security is a dangerous day for the world.

We have to get him out of the White House. Chip in to help make him a one-term president:"
"At 1:00 PM, I'll be speaking about the escalating situation with Iran and the imperative need to restore respected, responsible, and dignified leadership on the world stage. Tune in to watch live:"
"Trump wants to ignore climate science when making infrastructure decisions. In the Biden Administration, every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to reduce and withstand a changing climate."
"On Día de los Reyes, as Christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach. Jill and I wish a Happy Three Kings’ Day to all!"
Let's be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.
I stand in solidarity with those marching in New York against the rise of anti-Semitism. This is what the battle for the soul of our nation looks like — and it's up to all of us to reject intolerance in all its forms and give hate no safe harbor.
"Our Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. But Donald Trump has slammed the door in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. Jill traveled to Matamoros to shed light on how these policies hurt asylum seekers."
"This is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed pulling out of the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He has failed on both counts.

He is the most erratic and incompetent commander in chief we’ve ever had."
"Hey @realDonaldTrump, do you think the American people want another war in the Middle East? Des Moines certainly doesn’t."
"The more the walls close in on this guy, the more irrational he becomes."
"The world is burning, yet Donald Trump continues to deny the evidence of climate change before all of our eyes. We have to get him out of the White House and take urgent global action to combat the climate crisis before it’s too late."
"This simply shouldn’t happen in America. Folks deserve access to affordable, quality long-term care in their homes. 

We have to fight for Alex and those who use long-term care."
"We can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but if we give him eight years in the White House he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can't let that happen."
"On the trail, I hear countless stories from folks whose lives have been changed by Obamacare. We can't afford to start over—we need a president who will protect and build on it to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable care."
"The prospect of direct conflict with Iran is greater than ever. Does Donald Trump have a strategy for what comes next?

Nothing we have seen from this Administration suggests that they are prepared to deal with the risks we now confront."
We need a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces of Donald Trump's broken foreign policy and repair the damage he has caused around the world.
"Our world has been set on edge by an erratic, unstable, and dangerously incompetent commander in chief. The stakes could not be higher. Every day that Donald Trump directs American national security is a dangerous day for the United States and the world."
My statement on the killing of Qassem Soleimani.
Donald Trump stacked the Supreme Court with justices to try to overturn Roe v. Wade—and now Republicans are seizing the opportunity to restrict a woman's constitutional right to choose. We have to fight these attacks and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor.
"We're just one full day into 2020 and there have already been at least three mass shootings across the country.
 
Enough is enough. We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic."
"Before the holidays, Jill walked across the Gateway International Bridge into Matamoros, Mexico, where families are enduring inhumane conditions. Jill witnessed the cruelty of Trump's policies and the resiliency of those risking their lives to seek asylum."
"If you're a teacher or a firefighter, you're probably paying more in taxes than Amazon or Netflix. We've got to make sure corporations pay their fair share."
I'm excited to share that we raised $22.7 million this last quarter — our biggest quarter so far this campaign! Thank you to everyone who chipped in what you could — your support means the world to me. You truly are the heart of our campaign.

"It was a privilege to work with @JulianCastro during the Obama Administration, and a true honor to be in this talented field of candidates with him. He led his historic campaign with grace and heart and used his platform to lift the voices of others. Thank you, Mr. Secretary."
Every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House puts the future of our planet at risk. We have to beat him this November and take immediate action to address the climate emergency.
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
"With just over one month until the Iowa Caucus, we need all hands on deck to talk with folks about what's at stake in this election.

Join our team today and let's get to work:"
"Every single human being deserves to be treated with dignity. Everyone. The poor and the powerless, the marginalized and vulnerable, the “least of these.” That has been the animating principle of my life and my faith."
"Our final fundraising deadline of 2019 is just hours away and we need your help. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way to helping us make Donald Trump a one-term president.

Chip in before midnight to help us reach our goal:"
"As we move into the New Year, there's one thing I know: in 2020 we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country."
2019 was a year of record violence — it will be a moral failure if we allow 2020 to be the same. We have to elect leaders with the courage to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform. We have to end this epidemic.
"Next year could give us one of two things: a new administration or four more years of Donald Trump.

We can defeat him, but only with your help. Chip in what you can before our midnight deadline:"
It will take years to repair the damage Betsy DeVos is doing to our schools. Our students and educators deserve a Secretary of Education who values our public schools — and is actually an educator.
"We all said that Donald Trump’s trade war would lead to job losses and higher prices.

And now, it’s leading to job losses and higher prices.

I didn't read “Art of the Deal,” but this is the textbook definition of a failed negotiation."
"Tomorrow marks our end-of-year fundraising deadline and we need your help to reach our goal. Our campaign relies on supporters like you giving $5, $10, $20 at a time.

Chip in to help us end the year on a strong note:"
"Health care should be more than just a luxury reserved for those who can afford it. It’s a right we all deserve – one that is central to our dignity, and to who we want to be as a country."
"My dad had a saying: “Joey, the greatest sin of all is the abuse of power.”

Right now, our democracy is at risk. We’ve got to come together and fight back against Donald Trump — Democrats, Republicans, Independents alike."
Scripture is clear: It’s not enough to just wish the world were better. It’s our duty to make it so—including by leading the world in addressing the climate crisis and providing a roadmap to citizenship for those contributing to our communities.
"Congressman Lewis has always fought in the name of building a more just, more fair country. If there's anybody who can take the fight to cancer, it's you, John. Jill and I are sending our prayers to you and your family. Keep the faith, and keep up the fight."
No one in America should work full time and live below the poverty line. It’s past time we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and provide a reliable pathway to the middle class.
"Donald Trump will stop at nothing to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we've made. We have to protect the ACA and build on it to ensure every American has access to quality, affordable care."

The subpoenas should go to witnesses with testimony to offer to Trump’s shaking down the Ukraine government — they should go to the White House.
"But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial. That is the point I was making yesterday and I reiterate: this impeachment is about Trump’s conduct, not mine."
"I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office — unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence — cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests."
"Our end-of-year fundraising deadline is quickly approaching — and we need your help to reach our goal in order to make the investments in Iowa necessary to win.

With just 38 days until the caucus, we need every dollar we can get. Chip in today:"
"Donald Trump is a threat to the future of our planet. Over the last year, he has rolled back regulations on:

- Methane leaks
- Auto pollution
- Clean water protections 
- Endangered species protections

We have to get him out of the White House."
This is a big victory in the fight for voting rights. We should be making voting easier — not harder — and ensure every American can make their voice heard at the ballot box.
"Next year the American people will decide who we are as a nation and, perhaps even more importantly, who we want to be. We are so much better than who President Donald Trump thinks we are."

"There is no denying the existential threat of climate change — and time is running out to address it. If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, our planet may never recover."
It’s simple: companies should have to compete for workers just like they compete for customers. We should get rid of non-compete clauses and no-poaching agreements that do nothing but suppress wages.
"Our firefighters work tirelessly to make our communities safer, better places to live. We need a president who supports them and rewards work, not wealth."
We can’t let the scourge of gun violence tear our communities apart any longer. We need to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense reforms to end our gun violence epidemic.
Donald Trump should release his taxes or shut up about corruption.
"After the most corrupt administration in modern American history, the next president faces a big task: restoring faith in American government. We must root out corruption and ensure our government works for the people — not the powerful."

"The middle class is getting killed. 40% of farmers in the midwest couldn’t pay their bills last year. We have to make sure the middle class has a shot, and that’s why we must change this Presidency now. #DemDebate"
"The science is clear: we need action now, and we can't do it alone. As president, I will take unprecedented action at home and abroad to tackle the climate crisis head on. #DemDebate"

Our children's future and the success of America stands on the shoulders of public school educators. Educators deserve to have fair wages and the resources they need to be able to do their jobs.
The defining characteristic of the Trump Administration is the abuse of power.
"Joe Burrow worked hard to reach the pinnacle of college football, but he never forgot the everyday struggle of the community he came from. Joe - your humility is inspiring. Thank you for reminding us to never forget those less fortunate than us."
"John Dingell was an American patriot and a selfless public servant — and Debbie Dingell has carried his legacy in the House with grace and dignity. This is equally as cruel as it is pathetic, and it is beyond unconscionable that our President would behave this way."
Donald Trump failed to repeal the ACA in Congress. Now he has turned to the courts to sabotage it — and is threatening protections for more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions in the process. We need to protect Obamacare — and build on it.
"President Trump abused his power, violated his oath of office, and betrayed our nation. This is a solemn moment for our country. But in the United States of America, no one is above the law — not even the President."
"With just 47 days until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to talk with voters across the country about what's at stake in this election. You can make a difference from wherever you live by going to   to get involved."
Deberíamos dedicar las mentes más brillantes de Estados Unidos a resolver la epidemia de violencia armada. Estos fondos para la investigación sobre las causas y la prevención de la violencia armada debieron haberse otorgado hace mucho tiempo.
"We have to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we’re going to ensure that everyone comes along."
I have long been a skeptic on Afghanistan. We must learn the lessons of the past 18 years. It is long past time to end America’s longest war and focus on what is achievable: a narrow counterterrorism mission. #DemDebate
"I refuse to accept the notion that we can never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that’s the case, we’re dead as a country. When we can’t convince them, we have to go out and beat them. #DemDebate"
"The United States and our partners make up more than half of global GDP. If we stand together, China won’t be able to withstand the pressure. We should be mobilizing our allies to meet this challenge, not driving them away. #DemDebate"
"America's commitment to Israel’s security must be unwavering. The Obama-Biden administration provided unprecedented levels of assistance, including for Iron Dome. But true peace and security for Israelis & Palestinians requires a two-state solution. Trump has set us back."

"Hate didn’t begin with Donald Trump, and it won’t end with him. But this is a defining moment in our nation’s history. A moment where we are once again called to fight against the same forces of hate and intolerance that we've battled throughout history."
We should be dedicating America’s brightest minds to solving the gun violence epidemic. This funding for research on the causes and prevention of gun violence is long overdue.
Glad to hear @UNITEHERE11 and Sodexo reached a tentative agreement that provides workers with the wages and benefits they deserve. I look forward to joining the debate tomorrow to discuss how I'll strengthen our unions and build an inclusive middle class.
It is long past time that every American has 12 weeks of paid leave to address their own health needs or care for any of their loved ones.
It's about time that federal workers get paid parental leave. Congratulations to @BrianSchatz and @CarolynBMaloney for pushing this bill over the finish line in Congress.
We need a president our children can look up to.
"Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how morally unfit he is to lead our country. We must make him a one-term president."
.@JohnKerry is a patriot who has dedicated his life to serving our country. I'm lucky to call him a friend and honored to have his endorsement.
Let’s call this what it is: a right-wing effort to influence our elections and make it harder for folks to vote. We have to fight these partisan attacks on our democracy and ensure everyone can make their voice heard at the ballot box.
There is no time to waste when it comes to addressing the existential threat of climate change. We need a president who is ready on day one to rally the world to meet the urgency of this crisis.
"If Donald Trump is re-elected, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation forever. We can't let that happen."
"Amazon, Netflix, General Motors, Chevron, Starbucks, and 86 other corporations paid less in federal income taxes than you did last year. It's wrong — and it needs to end.

It's time corporations pay their fair share."
We must take on the @NRA and get these weapons of war off our streets.

"As president, I’ll partner with American farmers to combat climate change and make U.S. agriculture the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions — all while giving farmers a new source of income in the process."
"These kids and their families suffered unimaginable horror and loss. This past weekend—7 years to the day of the Sandy Hook massacre—they won the state championship.

They give me hope, and can teach us all a lesson about resilience in the face of tragedy."
It is within our capacity to end the gun violence epidemic. We need a president who will take on the @NRA and beat them (again).

Donald Trump has presided over the most corrupt administration in modern American history.
"Our teachers aren’t just educators — they’re coaches. They’re giving our children the confidence they need to grow, just like they did when I was a kid. If we want to invest in the future of America, it starts with supporting our teachers."
Climate change is a global crisis that requires a global response. Sign this petition if you think the United States should rejoin the Paris Agreement:
"As president, I’ll call for an unprecedented investment in our country’s infrastructure so the American middle class can compete and win in the global economy. Read my full plan here:"
"Seven years after Newtown, we have to ask ourselves: what kind of nation are we if we simply accept that kids learn active shooter drills with their ABCs?

We can defeat the NRA. And we'll use every tool of our democracy to do it."
Donald Trump doesn’t know who we are as a country. We’re a nation of immigrants — and our diversity has always been our biggest strength.
There is enormous opportunity once we get Donald Trump out of the White House. My administration will tackle the climate emergency head-on and create 10 million jobs to power the clean energy economy of the future.
I won't be crossing a picket line. We’ve got to stand together with @UniteHere11 for affordable health care and fair wages. A job is about more than just a paycheck. It's about dignity.

"I applaud the Senate's landmark legislation formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide. If we don't fully acknowledge the past, “never again” loses its meaning. The facts must be as clear and as powerful for future generations as for those whose memories are seared by tragedy."
President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes — and we’re all paying the price. We must get him out of the White House and treat climate change like the existential threat it is.

"Trump’s reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has put our ability to confront the climate crisis in jeopardy. It proves he doesn’t have any idea of what we’re up against, despite indisputable evidence. And it again confirms that he's incapable of real leadership."

We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — we cannot let him define us as a nation.
"We must take urgent action to end Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policies. In my first 100 days, we will:

- End his inhumane asylum policies
- End wasteful efforts to build a wall
- Reverse “Muslim bans”
- Reverse his “public charge” rule
- Protect Dreamers & TPS holders"

As president, I'll renew a robust commitment to U.S. leadership and pursue a comprehensive strategy of support for Central America:"
You shouldn’t be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Period.
Our gun laws make these hate-filled attacks even more deadly. We must pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of dangerous hands and work to end our gun violence epidemic.
.@DrBiden and I are keeping those affected by this hate-filled attack in our hearts. We cannot be silent in the face of anti-Semitism. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry and to give hate no safe harbor.
Being a nation of immigrants has always been one of our greatest strengths. Our diversity makes us stronger. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
"Immigration has always made us stronger—it’s essential to who we are. But Donald Trump has waged an assault on our values as a nation of immigrants.

As president, I'll undo Trump’s damage and put our values back at the heart of our immigration system:"

"It’s been just two months since John Deere laid off 160 workers in the Quad Cities in part because of President Trump’s reckless trade war—and now, a second round of layoffs is expected in the same community.

Trump’s failed policies are destroying American jobs."
"36,878 — that’s how many Americans have died from gun violence so far this year. We cannot go on like this any longer. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic."
"Donald Trump is erratic, unstable, and dangerously incompetent. Every day that he directs our national security is a dangerous day for the United States."
We can make Donald Trump a one-term president and take back this country — but we cannot do it without your help. Join our team today and let’s get to work:

"It is within our grasp to end our gun violence epidemic. As president, I will hold gun manufacturers accountable, get weapons of war off our streets, and keep guns out of dangerous hands. Read my full plan:"
".@DrBiden and I send our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of former Iowa congressman and statesman, Berkley Bedell. Congressman Bedell’s legacy will be remembered as the epitome of public service. Iowa is a better place because he served there."
"I’m glad the Senate passed the #FUTUREAct to permanently fund historically black colleges and universities, and other minority-serving institutions. I’ll invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build new facilities, and support student success."
We cannot stand by and let Donald Trump destroy the character of our nation. We must make him a one-term president.
"Today, we remember Pearl Harbor and those we lost — like Seaman Roy Powers and Seaman Jimmy Palides who we honored today in Oelwein, Iowa.

It’s an opportunity to reflect on all our veterans’ sacrifices, and recommit to ensuring they receive the care they have earned."
"Marge turns 100 soon, so I asked her about her secret to longevity."

.@DrBiden and I join communities around the world in marking #HumanRightsDay. This day is a time of reflection and recommitment to the notion that all human beings are equal in dignity and rights.
"It’s been just two months since John Deere laid off 160 workers in the Quad Cities in part because of President Trump’s reckless trade war—and now, a second round of layoffs is expected in the same community.

Trump’s failed policies are destroying American jobs."
"36,878 — that’s how many Americans have died from gun violence so far this year. We cannot go on like this any longer. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic."
"Donald Trump is erratic, unstable, and dangerously incompetent. Every day that he directs our national security is a dangerous day for the United States."
We can make Donald Trump a one-term president and take back this country — but we cannot do it without your help. Join our team today and let’s get to work:
"No matter where you start in life, there should be no limit to what you can achieve. We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and this time, make sure everyone comes along."
"Educators deserve a partner in the White House. As president, I will support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve. Learn more about my plan for educators, students, and our future:"
"Prescription drug companies are profiteering off the pocketbooks of sick individuals — it’s wrong. As president, I will stand up to the abuse of power by drug corporations and put an end to runaway drug prices. Read my full plan here:"
"It is our moral responsibility to end gender-based violence. And as president, I will lead the global effort to end sexual violence. #16Days"
"We cannot go on denying the devastating effects of climate change — we must choose science over fiction. As president, I will address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing the climate emergency."
"It is within our grasp to end our gun violence epidemic. As president, I will hold gun manufacturers accountable, get weapons of war off our streets, and keep guns out of dangerous hands. Read my full plan:"
".@DrBiden and I send our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of former Iowa congressman and statesman, Berkley Bedell. Congressman Bedell’s legacy will be remembered as the epitome of public service. Iowa is a better place because he served there."
"I’m glad the Senate passed the #FUTUREAct to permanently fund historically black colleges and universities, and other minority-serving institutions. I’ll invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build new facilities, and support student success."
We cannot stand by and let Donald Trump destroy the character of our nation. We must make him a one-term president.
"Today, we remember Pearl Harbor and those we lost — like Seaman Roy Powers and Seaman Jimmy Palides who we honored today in Oelwein, Iowa.

It’s an opportunity to reflect on all our veterans’ sacrifices, and recommit to ensuring they receive the care they have earned."
"Marge turns 100 soon, so I asked her about her secret to longevity."
"We have a Secretary of Education who doesn't value our public schools, an EPA Administrator who doesn’t believe that climate change is an existential threat, and an Attorney General who puts the selfish interests of the President ahead of the American people. We deserve better."
"It's the final day of the #NoMalarkey barnstorm, but the enthusiasm we’ve seen could make a big difference in the next few weeks before the Iowa Caucus.

We need your help to keep this momentum going—contribute today to keep fueling our efforts:"
"House Democrats have passed legislation to: 

- Enact universal background checks
- Reauthorize VAWA

It’s time for @senatemajldr McConnell to do his job and bring these bills up for a vote."
Couldn't have said it better myself! I’m honored to have @JohnKerry join me for the #NoMalarkey barnstorm.
We deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding.
"Today, House Democrats led the way by passing a bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. All but one Republican voted against it. Shameful. Strengthening our democracy should not be a partisan issue. #HR4 #RestoreTheVote"
"The Voting Rights Act used to be one of our best tools to fight state laws designed to suppress the vote — particularly the votes of people of color. Then it was gutted by the Supreme Court, and Congressional Republicans have refused a legislative fix."
"I’m so proud and so humbled to have @JohnKerry's support. He is an American hero, statesman, visionary, and friend. His endorsement and partnership mean the world to me."
I'm proud to stand with @SEIU1984 and NH’s state employees as they fight for fair wages — Governor Sununu cannot shortchange workers with a contract that doesn't fairly compensate them. #UnionsForAll #NHPolitics
.@DrBiden and I send our prayers to those affected by today's tragic shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola. We're grateful for the brave first responders who rushed to the scene and selflessly risked their lives to save others.
"A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be okay—and mean it. Too many people today can’t do that.

We have to rebuild an inclusive middle class and restore the dignity of work."
This administration is morally bankrupt.
We need a president who is respected on the world stage.
"Congratulations @AFLCIO on 64 years of empowering workers to bargain for what they deserve. The 40-hour workweek, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace safety — it’s all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that."
"Nuestro presidente debería ser capaz de cumplir con una prueba simple: entender que los puertorriqueños son ciudadanos americanos y que tienen derecho a, y merecen, el mismo apoyo del gobierno de los Estados Unidos que todos los demás ciudadanos."
"Our president should be able to meet a simple test: understanding that Puerto Ricans are American citizens, and that they are entitled to—and deserve—the same support from the United States government as every citizen.

Donald Trump has failed that test."
DREAMers are Americans — and it’s time we make it official. We must keep our promise to them and provide a pathway to citizenship.
"President Trump continues to embarrass us on the world stage. We need a president who is ready on day one to repair our global reputation and restore American leadership abroad.

But I can't get to the White House without your help, chip in today:"
"As president, I’ll make sure giant corporations and the super-wealthy pay their fair share in taxes — and then invest that money in growing a stronger, more inclusive middle class."
"President Trump is destroying American leadership and credibility abroad. As president, I'll rebuild a modern, agile U.S. Department of State—investing in and re-empowering the finest diplomatic corps in the world."
My administration will spark the second great railroad revolution to propel our nation's infrastructure into the future and help solve the climate emergency.

"The world is laughing at President Trump. They see him for what he really is: dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.

We cannot give him four more years as commander in chief."
"Take a look inside the #NoMalarkey bus with my favorite road trip partner, @DrBiden."
"We are in a battle for the soul of America. It’s time we come together, remember who we are, and take this country back."
"Nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide are subjected to physical violence, rape or stalking by a partner at some point in their lives. As president, I’ll tackle this epidemic head-on, and work to end violence against women. #16Days"
"The Trump Administration's ""Infrastructure Weeks"" have been a bunch of malarkey. As president, I'll make a transformational investment in our nation's infrastructure and future."
I applaud Monday's sentences against seven of the men found guilty of killing Honduran environmental leader Berta Caceres. Environmentalists and human rights activists should not have to fear for their lives. #JusticeForBerta
"Every worker deserves fair wages, good benefits, and protections from sexual harassment. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @hgsuuaw. I urge the university to negotiate in good faith to secure a fair contract with good health care benefits."
"I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild a more inclusive middle class, and unite all Americans.

If you’re with me, let me know by chipping in to our campaign today:"
Kamala Harris is an incredible talent with unlimited potential. Her career has been defined by taking on those who abuse power and seeking equity and justice for all people. Her intellect and insight will continue to be needed by the Democratic Party and the country.
"Everyone deserves the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care. My administration will give people the choice between their existing plan and a Medicare-like public option. It’s the most effective way to achieve universal coverage."
Confirmed: true.
"In the United States of America, we leave nobody behind — no matter your race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. We need a president who understands that."
"If we don’t take urgent action to address the climate emergency, our planet may never recover. We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and tackle this crisis head-on."
"My team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us. And yes, we can have ice cream for dessert!

Time is running out to enter — chip in for your chance to win:"
We must get these weapons of war out of our communities. #NoMalarkey
"I’ve always believed we are strongest when we act as one America. If we come together and unite this country, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.

If you agree, join our team today:"
".@GovernorBullock and I have always agreed on a central tenet of his campaign: every American deserves a fair shot. He has served Montana well and will continue to do so with fairness and strength. Thank you, Governor."
"Meet Richard. Find out why he, like millions of Americans, supports protecting and expanding Obamacare."
American leadership has served as the backbone of NATO since its founding 70 years ago — until President Trump. His abdication of America’s traditional leadership role could not come at a more critical moment for the alliance.
"64 years ago today, Rosa Parks' courageous act forever changed our country and the course of history. We must continue to follow her brave example and speak out against injustice, wherever it is found."

We’re officially on the road for our eight-day #NoMalarkey Tour across Iowa!
Congressman and former Admiral @JoeSestak has served his country bravely for decades. He ran his campaign with the same standards of strength and respect he has held his entire life. Thank you for your service.
Every voter counts. We need a president who is ready to listen to every voice.
"Over the last 30 years, the fight against #HIV has taught us to be big-hearted; to follow the science; to treat everyone with dignity and respect, and to protect the human rights of all who walk this planet. #WorldAIDSDay"
"Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.

We must make him a one-term president."
"It's clear who President Trump works for. His administration prioritized giant tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations — meanwhile, they've attacked food assistance every chance they've gotten. It’s heartless.

No one should go hungry in America."
Fired up and ready to go for the #NoMalarkey barnstorm!
"Jill and I would like to extend our greetings to those celebrating the Hmong New Year. Wishing you joyous, colorful celebrations throughout the country filled with music, quality time with family, and all blessings for new beginnings — Nyob Zoo Xyoo Tshiab!"
"26 years ago, I fought to get the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act passed — and established the background check system that has kept guns out of the hands of so many dangerous individuals.

I’ve taken on the @NRA and beaten them — twice. As president, I’ll do it again."
"Today, and every day, I encourage you to shop locally and support the folks in your community working hard every day. #SmallBusinessSaturday"
"I’m incredibly thankful for the supportive members of #TeamJoe across the country working hard every day for our campaign.

I’d love to know what you’re thankful for. Share your story here:"
"Every single community should have access to clean, safe drinking water. Period.

As president, I will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities."
"It's time we start rewarding work, not just wealth. As president, I'll reverse Trump's tax cuts for the super-wealthy and build a stronger, more inclusive middle class."
"Tomorrow, we’re kicking off our eight-day, 18 county “No Malarkey” barnstorm across Iowa! I’d love to see you there. Head to   to find an event in your community."
"Not a joke, folks. To celebrate Black Friday we’re giving you an extra 10% off our #TeamJoe gear! Head to   and use the code ‘BlackFridayDeal’ to receive your discount."
"I believe in redemption. As president, I’ll ensure that those who were formerly incarcerated have the opportunity to fully reintegrate into society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy as our fellow citizens.

Read my full plan here:"
Jill and I greatly admire the work of @NobelPrize laureate @DenisMukwege and @PanziHospital for raising awareness and caring for survivors of sexual violence in eastern Congo. We must end impunity for perpetrators. #16Days
Thank you @JeanneShaheen for leading the fight to ensure that women veterans have the resources they need to be safe from violence. One of my top priorities as president will be to renew and expand VAWA — including passing this bill.
"We have so much to be thankful for — today and every day. Happy Thanksgiving to those serving overseas who can’t be home with family, and to Americans in every corner of the country. We hope your day is filled with family and friends, laughter, and gratitude."
I’ve dedicated my life to public service. We need a president who is ready on day one.

There’s no time for on-the-job training. We need a leader who is ready on day one."
"South Carolina’s Social Security number requirement is an unnecessary burden that discourages folks from participating in our political process. It's wrong and should be reversed. 
 
We should be making voting easier — not harder."
"I'm incredibly honored to have the endorsement of Tom and Christie Vilsack. I know with their support, we can win the Iowa caucus, earn the nomination, and beat Donald Trump next November."

Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We cannot stand by and watch that happen.

"Climate change is an existential threat to our planet — we must take action. 

As president, not only will I recommit us to the Paris Agreement — I’ll lead the world to up the ante in addressing our climate emergency."
"Thank you Tom and Christie Vilsack for your support. Together, we will win Iowa and move this countryforward."
"Our hearts go out to the families of Iranian protesters who were killed this past week. Iranians, like people everywhere, have a right to protest peacefully without being brutally attacked by their own government and having the internet shut down for days. The world is watching."
"The Trump Administration’s “Infrastructure Weeks” are a joke — but our crumbling roads and bridges are not.

We need a transformational investment in America’s infrastructure and future:"
"Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. He has to go. If you agree, chip in $5 to help us make him a one-term president:"
We’re officially on the ballot in South Carolina!
This election is about who we are and who we want to be. I believe we are a nation that welcomes those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum — not a nation that turns our back on them.
Corruption is Donald Trump’s middle name.
"We need to build an economy that reflects our values.

My administration will reverse the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations. We'll then use that money to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class."
Obamacare was and is a big deal. It saved lives and gave millions peace of mind. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over — we should protect and build on it.
"It’s clear that Donald Trump has abused the power of the presidency. Full stop.

He is the most corrupt president in modern American history."
"Campbell is an incredible young man, and I’m proud to have played a small part in his journey."
"We had a great night at the #DemDebate, but we need your help to keep this momentum going.

Our students and educators cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.
"It’s time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor."
"Weapons of war have no place in our communities.
 
I’ve successfully taken on the @NRA to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines before, and I’ll do it again in the White House."
"I’m running for president to build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability."

That’s all we have! Thanks for tagging along for tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
We have to fundamentally change the culture of how women are treated in this country. #DemDebate
"Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.

As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate"
"""In the United States Senate, I passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined."" #DemDebate"
"Over the last few days, there has been a lot of misinformation on where Joe Biden stands when it comes to our marijuana laws. Read the facts below. #DemDebate"
25 years ago Joe Biden led the fight to pass the Violence Against Women Act and as president he’s going to build on it. #DemDebate
"""It's the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney."" #DemDebate"
"Joe will take on changing the culture on our college campuses that enables sexual violence, building on the #ItsOnUs effort he started with President Obama. #DemDebate"
"Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate"
"Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant."
"More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate"
It’s not who we are. We are better than this. #DemDebate
Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate

"In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage."
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate
"Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate"
We are fired up and ready for Joe to take the stage at tonight’s #DemDebate!
"Hey folks, it’s @TeamJoe here! We’ll be taking over Joe’s account tonight to keep you updated on all things #DemDebate. Grab some ice cream and follow along!"
"I’m about to take the stage for tonight’s #DemDebate, so I’m passing the account over to my team. They’ll keep you in the loop throughout the night on everything happening. Follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates. Tune in to @MSNBC at 9 PM ET to watch live!"
"The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again."
"When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one."
"When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy."
"When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again."
"When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system."
"This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be."
I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level.
"I am deeply disturbed by the news coming out of my law school alma mater, Syracuse University. We are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor."
"On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear."
"Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay"
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
"I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.

It has now been 264 days. How many more senseless shootings must occur before Senate Republicans take action? Enough is enough.
There is a lot of talk out there on where I stand when it comes to our marijuana laws. Here are the facts:
I’ve witnessed the heroism of firefighters firsthand — selflessly rushing into danger to help others. They represent the best of our country. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to the loved ones of Worcester Fire Lt. Jason Menard for their loss.
"Sunday night in a backyard. Monday morning at a store. We must do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic because we cannot go on like this any longer.

Our hearts go out to those affected by these senseless tragedies."
"I’m inspired by the strength and resilience of Chrissy and survivors across the country, and proud of the change the Violence Against Women Act created, but we still have further to go.

Today, I released my plan to build on VAWA:"
China’s internment of nearly one million Uighur Muslims is among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today. The U.S. cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world.
"I’ve spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power. That’s what motivated me to write & champion the Violence Against Women Act. The law helped change our culture—but there’s more work to do.

Today, I’m releasing my plan to end violence against women:"
"Corporations need to pay their fair share in taxes.
 
I’ll reverse Trump’s giveaway to the super-wealthy and corporations because it’s time we reward work, not just wealth."
I know if we come together and stand united as a nation - anything is possible.
"At the CNN Town Hall, I was asked what changes in American society I’m proudest of. Here’s what I had to say:"
"I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability."
The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns.
"Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional & the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops."
"The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support & thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn & harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve."
"My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.
 
If you want to grab dinner, chip in today:"
America is more equal because of Chief Justice Mark Cady. His landmark decision brought marriage equality to Iowa and pushed our nation closer to our highest ideals. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to his loved ones. His integrity and commitment to justice will be missed.
"I am deeply concerned about the unjust detainment of Jose Daniel Ferrer, a voice for change in Cuba, by the Cuban government. Ferrer must be released at once."
Two elections. Zero criminal convictions.

".@realDonaldTrump, release your taxes or shut up about corruption."
This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism.

The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the atrocities President Trump continues to carry out at the border. This is not who we are.
I will always choose hope over fear.
"You shouldn't be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Under my plan, you will be able to keep them."
This decision puts the health of the American people at risk — it’s unacceptable. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and choose science over fiction once again.
"First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy."
"We have to lead the world by our example and make clear that human rights, civil rights, and civil liberties matter to us."
"Every American deserves access to affordable, quality health care, and Obamacare’s open enrollment is happening now. If you are uninsured, want to change your plan, or know someone who needs health care, visit   to #GetCovered."
"The next president will face an enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America’s foreign policy and salvaging our reputation.

I'm the only candidate in this race ready for that job on day one — and 133 top foreign policy officials agree."
"Change starts at the local level — I learned that firsthand as a 28-year-old on the New Castle County Council. On #NationalRunforOfficeDay, I'm asking you to join me and run for something. There is too much at stake in 2020 to sit on the sidelines."
"President Trump's erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our national security and set our world on edge. Every day that he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States."
Every worker should have the chance to join a union which bargains to ensure they get paid a living wage and have protections against sexual harassment. That's why I'm proud to stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking in Detroit and across the country today.
Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist threats. It is intolerable that Israeli civilians live their lives under the constant fear of rocket attacks. That's why our administration was such a strong supporter of Israel's life-saving Iron Dome.
DREAMers should be treated like the Americans that they are. It's past time for Congress to provide a pathway to citizenship and a fair shot at the American dream. #HomeIsHere
"The Sandy Hook families who paid such a bitter price deserve their day in court – and all American families deserve laws that protect them, and that put their children, not big gun corporations, first."
"Jill and I want to extend our best wishes to our friends in the Sikh community who are observing the 550th anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism."
DREAMers know more about what it means to be an American than you ever will.
"As president, I will ensure DREAMers are recognized as the Americans they are. In the meantime, the Supreme Court should overturn Donald Trump’s cruel decision so that DREAMers can continue to live fully in the only country they have ever known. Their #HomeIsHere."
"I just finished tonight’s CNN Town Hall, where I laid out my vision for our future and how I’ll deliver real progress for working families.

I know we can defeat Donald Trump and take back this country, but we can’t do it without your help. Chip in today:"
Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation. He should be impeached.
"At tonight's @CNN Town Hall in Iowa, I laid out my bold vision for the country and why I'm the best candidate in this race to beat Donald Trump and unite our nation.

If you liked what you heard, join our team and let's get to work:"
Looking forward to joining @ErinBurnett for tonight’s town hall in Iowa to discuss what’s at stake in this election and why I’m running for president. Tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live.
Our veterans and their families represent the absolute best that our country has to offer. I had the honor of spending Veterans Day in Iowa with a few of them.

"The campaign trail is always more fun when you join, @DrBiden. What a great weekend in New Hampshire!"
"President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families. 

As president, I will meet our sacred obligation."
"We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.

Thank you to all who have served — on Veterans Day and every day."
"I understand the sleepless nights, wondering if your deployed child is safe, and all the added sacrifices military families face because their loved one chose selfless service.

As president, I'll take care of our troops and their families."
Less than 1% of our population risks everything to protect our country — the other 99% of us owe them more than we could ever repay. #VeteransDay
"Today, I’m releasing my plan to ensure our veterans receive what they deserve: our respect and enduring gratitude, and the benefits they have earned.  

Read my full plan:"
"The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by the men and women who defend our nation at war. Veterans Day offers us a moment to reflect on that obligation, and to recommit ourselves to all that it truly means."
"Together we can, and will, make Donald Trump a one-term president."
We don’t say it enough — Barack Obama was a great president. And I’m proud to have worked alongside him.
"HBCUs and MSIs play a vital role in our communities. As president, I’ll invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.

Read my full plan:"
"I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.

If you’re with me, join us:"
"The ACA was, and is, a big deal. It took generations of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done. 

I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat."
"There is no denying the devastating effects climate change has on our planet — we need to take action. 

As president, I’ll lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at  ."
"Thirty years ago today, the people of Berlin tore down a wall and vanquished a dictatorship. We must not forget the lessons of 1989. The United States must reclaim its mantle as the champion of democracy. The stakes are simply too high."
"Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them."
"My plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.

Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same. Read my full plan:"
A fresh Fall day in New Hampshire spent serving chili to our nation’s finest — firefighters.
"Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare."
"We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy."
Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic.

"This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country."
"25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education."
"President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day."
"It’s official — we’re on the ballot in New Hampshire. 

Join us:  ."
"Every kid deserves a quality education and every family deserves to live in a safe, healthy community. That's why I support the California #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst initiative that will make corporations pay their fair share and invest in our communities to help them thrive."
"I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we unite this country, America’s best days still lie ahead.

If you agree, chip in today:"
I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.
"As California continues to burn, President Trump wants to withhold critical aid and abandon our firefighters when they need our support the most. It's reckless and cruel.

We must act now on climate change and support our firefighters and those affected by this disaster."
"The courage and determination of folks like @fred_guttenberg have turned the fight for gun safety reform from a cause to a movement.

Together, we will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic."
"Donald Trump wants to talk about corruption? That’s rich coming from the most corrupt president in modern history.

Tell Trump to release his taxes or shut up about corruption:"
Getting the Violence Against Women Act passed is one of the highlights of my whole career. Now Senate Republicans are refusing to reauthorize it. To all the advocates and survivors speaking out - your voice makes all the difference. It always has. So keep it up. #VAWA4ALL
We’ve come too far with the Affordable Care Act to tear it down and start over. Building on Obamacare with a new public option is the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage.
"Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security."
"Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House."
"Last night's results showed that Democrats can take back our country, starting with Virginia, and begin the hard work of growing a stronger, more inclusive middle class and restoring the soul of our nation.

Chip in to help us take back the White House:"
I'm running for president to unite this country. There's nothing we cannot do if we do it together.
"If you have DACA status, and it expires within the year, it’s critical that you renew as soon as possible to protect your status until we find a permanent solution.

DREAMers are Americans — and it’s time we make it official. #HomeIsHere"
"Hottest summer on record: 2019
Hottest September on record: 2019
Hottest October on record: 2019

There is no time to waste. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and address the climate emergency. The survival of our planet depends on it."
"To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country work: I see you, and I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America."
Congratulations to Governor-Elect @AndyBeshearKY on his hard-earned victory. He has served the people of Kentucky well as attorney general — the Commonwealth is in good hands with him in the governor's office.

"Tonight, by voting in Democratic majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, Virginians sent a clear, powerful message that will resonate across this nation and shake the walls of the White House."
The growing mountain of evidence makes one thing clear: We must impeach Donald Trump.
I have fought for the Democratic Party my whole career. That’s not something everyone in this primary can say.
Obamacare protects over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions — including Joe and Michelle’s son Matt. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it.
"Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform."
"Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on & off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL & @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program."
"Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness."
"The U.S. is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of the power of our example.

That’s what has always set us apart on the world stage, and that’s something Donald Trump will never understand."
"Faith, hope, and dignity sound good to me."
"Today is Election Day in Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey, Virginia, and cities across the nation. Your vote matters — find your polling place, bring a friend, and head to the polls to make your voice heard:"
11 years ago tonight.
"250 days. @Senatemajldr McConnell, do your job and bring the universal background check bill up for a vote."
"I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t President Trump?

He should release his taxes or shut up about corruption."
"As the climate crisis worsens each day and California burns and Iowa floods, Trump continues to abandon science and our international leadership. He just notified the United Nations of our official withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. It's shameful."
"President Trump has turned his back on those he promised to help. He thinks he’s being tough with his trade war, but he’s really being reckless. And American workers are paying the price. 

I will ensure our policies put American workers first."
"A country that ignores the threat to the very survival of this planet isn’t just troubled — it’s morally bankrupt.

We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and take urgent action to address the climate emergency."
Is anyone surprised that all it takes is a $100 saw to breach Trump’s wall? This whole exercise was a stunt and a sham from the beginning. The only thing the wall has succeeded in doing is tarnishing the image of our nation in the eyes of the world.
This is a dangerous decision by the Trump Administration. We should be strengthening our clean water protections and holding polluters accountable for their actions — not loosening restrictions on toxic waste.
"This Tuesday, we have the opportunity to set an example for the nation  and turn the Virginia state legislature blue. But only if everyone turns out to vote:"
"100 days until the New Hampshire primary.
One year until Election Day 2020.

There’s no time to waste, chip in $5 now to help us make Donald Trump a one-term president:"

"We have one year to determine the mark Donald Trump will leave on our country. There's too much at stake to take the next year for granted. We must work together to take back the White House, win the Senate, hold the House and elect Democrats down the ballot. #OneYearOneTeam"
Progress is bringing people together to get real results. It’s not accusing someone of being a Republican because they don’t share your approach to achieving universal health care. I know what it takes to get things done. I fought to pass Obamacare — I will fight to build on it.
The greed of drug companies fueled the opioid epidemic that has ravaged communities in every corner of the country. It’s time we hold pharmaceutical companies accountable.
"Our military deserves a commander-in-chief who ensures they have what they need when we send them into harm's way. Donald Trump betrays this sacred obligation. By abandoning partners who risk everything to stand at our side, Trump makes every future mission harder for our troops."
"No American should be denied shelter, medical care, or critical services because of who they are or who they love. As president, I will reverse these cruel and discriminatory acts from @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence, and I'll start by signing the Equality Act into law."
"The majority of middle class Americans don't think their kids will have the same standard of living they have — that's never happened before. Under my administration, every American will have a fightingshot."
"Once Donald Trump is out of the way, there is nothing we can’t do."
"It all starts in Iowa, on February 3rd. Together, we're going to take this nation back from DonaldTrump."
First thing I will do as president is rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. #LJ19

Progress is bringing people together to get real results. It’s not accusing someone of being a Republican because they don’t share your approach to achieving universal health care. I know what it takes to get things done. I fought to pass Obamacare — I will fight to build on it.
The greed of drug companies fueled the opioid epidemic that has ravaged communities in every corner of the country. It’s time we hold pharmaceutical companies accountable.
"Our military deserves a commander-in-chief who ensures they have what they need when we send them into harm's way. Donald Trump betrays this sacred obligation. By abandoning partners who risk everything to stand at our side, Trump makes every future mission harder for our troops."
"No American should be denied shelter, medical care, or critical services because of who they are or who they love. As president, I will reverse these cruel and discriminatory acts from @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence, and I'll start by signing the Equality Act into law."
"The majority of middle class Americans don't think their kids will have the same standard of living they have — that's never happened before. Under my administration, every American will have a fightingshot."
"Once Donald Trump is out of the way, there is nothing we can’t do."
"It all starts in Iowa, on February 3rd. Together, we're going to take this nation back from DonaldTrump."
First thing I will do as president is rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. #LJ19

"To every military family in our country: thank you, thank you, thank you."
The next president will inherit a world in disarray. There’s no time for on-the-job training — I’ll be ready on day one.
We must stop penalizing and criminalizing poverty.

One of my great honors as Vice President was speaking at the Air Force Academy commencement. We need a President who respects our troops.

You should be impeached."
"I know it’s Halloween, but Donald Trump has really been scaring me lately. 

Chip in $5 if he’s scaring you too:"
The American people can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump’s art of no deals.
Happy Halloween from the entire Biden family! We hope your night is filled with few tricks and plenty of treats.
"President Trump is undermining our health care and trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act at every turn. As a result, 400,000 additional children are uninsured. It’s cruel.

I will protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has access to the care they need."

My administration will repeal the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and reward work, not just wealth."

I support @Teamsters25 as they strike against @RepublicService for a living wage, health care, and pensions."
"Impeachment is not ""lynching,"" it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable."
"I strongly support the Senate's approval of North Macedonia's NATO membership. The countries of the Western Balkans deserve to be part of a Europe whole, free and at peace and we should be supporting Euro-Atlantic integration across the region."
"As president, I would press for dialogue to prevent further violence and instability. Investing in Haiti’s prosperity and security is in the national security interest of the United States."
The Trump Administration is abandoning the Haitian people while the country’s political crisis is paralyzing that nation.

Join me as we continue to build on the progress we've made:"
Donald Trump has no idea what it means to be a part of the middle class. I do.
"Let’s be clear, this ban is dangerous and directly violates a woman's constitutional right to choose. We must stop it.
 
As president, I will codify Roe into federal law and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor."
"Rooted in Scranton, fortified in the halls of Congress, and proven in the White House — my values have never changed, and they never will. I won’t stop fighting for the hardworking Americans who make our country run every single day."
Let's get something straight — unions built the middle class.
"We all want the same thing — a life of dignity and a fair shot at a better future.

Donald Trump isn't capable of understanding that."
"WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden Speaks in Scranton, Pennsylvania"
"This morning, I’ll be in my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plans to build a middle class where everyone comes along. Tune in at 10:00 AM ET to watch live:"
"Once again, Putin and the Russians are interfering in the elections and trying to pick our president -- this time they're coming after me.

Chip in $5 to send the message to Putin that the American people decide elections, not him:"
This wasn’t the right word to use and I’m sorry about that. Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.
"The moral obligation of our time is to restore, rebuild, and respect the backbone of America—the middle class. That mission will be my North Star as president."
Our gun and domestic violence epidemics are linked — and we must take action to end them both. Leader McConnell should allow a vote on the House-passed VAWA reauthorization to close loopholes and keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.

"Donald Trump talks tough on trade but has nothing to show for it—other than pain for America's families. Mike Pence has been his complicit sidekick, propping up Trump’s reckless trade wars and slighting hard-working Americans across the country."
"Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines have no place in our communities. I’ve taken on the @NRA to ban them once before, and I’ll do it again in the White House."
"After the most corrupt administration in modern history, the next president faces a big task: restoring faith in American government. A Biden administration will ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful."
"In the United States, health care should be a right for all — not a privilege for the few. As president, I will give Americans a new choice — a Medicare-like public option — to ensure everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they need."
"Donald Trump has asked three foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. In full view of the American people, he has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation.

He must be impeached."
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We’re going to make sure the next Secretary of Education is a teacher.
"I’m not going to be distracted by all of President Trump's lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. I’m going to stay focused on the issues that matter to you—because action cannot wait when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate."
"Thoughts and prayers won’t end our gun violence epidemic. 

It’s past time we take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform — that starts with banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and requiring universal background checks."
Hosting the G7 at Trump’s hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain.
"Let’s be clear — the effects of climate change are devastating. We need to take action. 

As president, I’ll not only address this grave threat— I’ll lead the rest of the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at  ."
"Our firefighters and teachers should not be paying a higher tax rate than the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, make sure everyone comes along."
"These moments, getting to speak with all of you...that's what keeps me going. We need a leader who cares. That's why I'm running for President."
"President Trump has relentlessly fought to sabotage and repeal Obamacare — I will not stand for it. 

I will protect and build on Obamacare as president, ensuring every American has peace of mind when it comes to their health care."
This is what being bought and paid for by the @NRA looks like. It’s cowardly.
"President Trump withheld Congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine unless they granted him a political favor. It's the definition of quid pro quo.

This is no joke—Trump continues to put his own personal, political interests ahead of the national interest. He must be impeached."
We’ve got to choose truth over lies — and that starts with getting Donald Trump out of the White House.
"15 years ago, I worked to help pass the North Korea Human Rights Act. We made our values clear to the brutal regime in Pyongyang. Trump has instead made excuses for the dictator in the North and refuses to appoint a special envoy for human rights in NK. It is disgraceful."

Trump is only reinstating “targeted” funds to Central America. I support full restoration of bipartisan funding to address root causes of the migration crisis—including the development aid proven to reduce violence and migration. Law enforcement alone is not enough.

"For days, pundits have let Donald Trump define the conversation around tonight's #DemDebate.

Well, Trump doesn't get to pick the Democratic nominee. And I’m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. He’s picked a fight with the wrong guy."
"Philadelphia's office cleaners work hard every day to keep the city's buildings clean. They deserve the dignity that comes with a living wage, access to health care, and a secure retirement. I stand with @32BJSEIU cleaners in their fight for a fair contract. #BuildingJustice"
"Overturning Citizens United isn’t enough. Ridding our politics of big money and corporate special interests demands more. We must go further.

I will introduce a constitutional amendment to get all private dollars out of our federal elections."
"President Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in modern American history. It’s got to end.

We must restore integrity to our government and ensure our elected officials work for all Americans — not just the powerful."
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history.
"The news from Fort Worth is heartbreaking. Atatiana Jefferson should still be alive today. We cannot allow this to keep happening, we must reform our policing practices and hold officers accountable for their actions."
"Donald Trump is the definition of corruption. At every turn, he has abused the power of the presidency to benefit his bottom line and weaponized the Executive Branch to serve himself.

I’ll ensure our government works for the people—not just Donald Trump."
"Overturning Citizens United is an important step in ending the corrupting influence of money in our politics, but we must go further.

As president, I will introduce a constitutional amendment to eliminate all private dollars from our federal elections."
"America was built on a simple proposition: we're all created equal. We haven't yet fully lived up to that ideal, but we've never stopped trying.

Transgender folks deserve every right afforded to Americans — and as president, I will fight to secure those rights."
"On #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we recognize the resiliency of indigenous communities and celebrate their rich contributions to society—while recommitting to the work that remains to come to terms with our past as a nation, to honor our promises, and work to right our wrongs."
"Our Constitution begins with three simple words, “We the People” — not “We the Donors.” But for too long, corporations and special interests have corrupted our political process and rigged it in their favor.

Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that:"
"Corporations should not value their profits over the health and safety of their employees. As president, I will significantly increase the number of inspectors within the pork and beef industries to ensure every individual has safe working conditions."
"President Trump betrayed our partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and endangered our hard-won gains against ISIS. Our troops are left in the middle of a war with no plan other than retreat.

He has failed as Commander-in-Chief to safeguard our country & protect our troops."
Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. He must be impeached.
It is wonderful to see Sesame Street raising awareness about the effect of substance use disorder on families. We need to be doing more to help parents experiencing addiction and support children who end up in foster care because of this issue.
"The Affordable Care Act has been under relentless attack for the past nine years — I will not stand for it. As president, I will protect and build on the ACA to ensure every American has peace of mind when it comes to their health care."
"Thank you, @UFCW! I promise you won’t have a better ally in the White House if I’m president. I’m a union guy and always have been. Together, we can restore the soul of thisnation."
"I’m about to take the stage at the @UFCW Presidential Forum in Iowa, where I’ll discuss my plans to strengthen America’s unions. Tune in to watch live:"
"The devastating effects of gun violence don’t end when the shooting is over—survivors may face mental health and substance use disorders in the months and years that follow.

Enough is enough. We must end this epidemic."
Thanks Sarah. I'm proud of you and so is Beau.
"A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class—not saddle you with mountains of debt. My new plan will provide two years of community college without debt, double Pell grants, invest $50 billion in workforce training programs, and more."
Immigrants have always made us stronger as a nation — our diversity has always been our greatest strength. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
"President Trump's attacks on Congresswoman Omar and Somali refugees have no place in our nation — let alone the White House.

A president should unite us around our shared goals and lift us up, not stoke the flames of hatred and tear us down."
"I was proud to work with Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, to extend our hate crimes law to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. But there’s still more work to be done — we can’t rest until every single American can live open and proud without fear."
"21 years ago, Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime — an attack that shook the conscience of our nation. As we honor his memory, we must remember that members of the LGBTQ community — especially trans women of color — are still targeted with violence."
"President Trump believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it.

Now, he is shooting holes in our Constitution. We cannot let him get away with it."
"We believe Americans should decide American elections. But Trump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic norms of our democracy. It's dangerous.

We cannot give him four more years in the White House."
"Overturning Citizens United is an important step in ending the corrupting influence of money in our politics, but we must go further.

On day one, I’ll take action to reverse the damage done by this administration and put America on track to lead the world in addressing the climate emergency."
"Let me make something clear to President Trump: I’m not going anywhere.

You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how dirty the attacks get."
"Living open and proud is a daily act of bravery — bravery that resides in the heart of every single LGBTQ individual.

Today is a reminder to every girl on the planet: nothing is beyond your capacity or capability. And all of us must work to ensure that girls around the world have the chance to participate fully in society and that their rights are respected. #DayoftheGirl
"To LGBTQ people suffering persecution anywhere: the American people are on your side. And as president, I will ensure the U.S. leads the world to defend human rights for all."
LGBTQ rights are human rights. Uganda's proposed new law is inhumane. Using religion or culture to license discrimination is never justifiable. Period.
"Using religion or culture to discriminate against or demonize LGBTQ individuals is never justified—not anywhere in the world.

I will send a clear message from the top of our government: prejudice is prejudice, inhumanity is inhumanity, and the U.S. will not stand for it."
"I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have. America is so much stronger than your weakness, @realDonaldTrump."
Honored to be asked a question at tonight's #EqualityTownHall by my friend Judy Shepard. It was a privilege to work with her to secure the passage of legislation that extended our hate crimes laws to crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
We have to make sure that no hospital or health care provider can discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. #EqualityTownHall
There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. Period. We've got to combat the stigma and ensure everyone has access to the care they need and deserve. #WorldMentalHealthDay
Looking forward to joining @AndersonCooper at tonight’s #EqualityTownHall to discuss the work that remains in the fight for LGBTQ rights. Tune in to CNN at 8PM ET to watch live.
"For all the hard-won progress we've made in the fight for LGBTQ equality, we're not done — not nearly.

We must stand up to President Trump's dangerous attacks on the rights of the LGBTQ community and continue to fight for full equality."
Americans should decide American elections. Period.
I sat down with @MaraKeisling of the @NCTEActionFund to discuss the progress we’ve made on LGBTQ rights and the work that remains. Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time—I won’t stop fighting until everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
President Trump picked a fight with the wrong guy.
"Trump made this decision on a whim, after a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan. There was no process. No consultation with our military, our diplomats, or our allies. Trump got rolled, plain and simple, because he has no idea what he's doing."
"But that's not all — he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them. He betrayed our word as a nation — raising doubts among our allies around the world about America's security commitments."
Donald Trump sold out the Syrian Democratic Forces — the courageous Kurds and Arabs who fought with us to smash ISIS's caliphate — and he betrayed a key local ally in the fight against terrorism.
"In full view of the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed this nation. He must be impeached."

We must prove him wrong. He must be impeached."
"Like every bully, President Trump is lashing out because he’s afraid. He’s afraid of how badly I will beat him next November.

Let’s make his worst fear a reality:"
"Only a little farther north, Timothy Ragland won his race to become both the youngest and first African American mayor of Talladega. I'm confident they will serve the people of Alabama well."
"Last night, history was made in the birthplace of the civil rights movement, when Steven Reed became the first African American mayor of Montgomery."
President Trump sees no limit to his power. He believes he can — and will — get away with anything he does.
"To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, and our basic integrity — Donald Trump should be impeached."
"Two days ago, Trump impulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military. Today, we see the consequences—Turkish forces attacking the fighters that helped us take on ISIS. It’s a betrayal, takes pressure off the terrorist threat, & leaves us less safe."
"Every day Donald Trump is in the White House, he poses a grave threat to our democracy. We must make him a one-term president.

Help us defeat him by pitching in to our Beat Trump Fund before midnight:"

"I have spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power.

Donald Trump has spent his entire career abusing his power."
"In public and in private, President Trump has asked foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. It is an abuse of power. We cannot let him get away with it.

Chip in to our Trump Rapid Response Fund to help us respond:"
Jill and I wish Jewish communities around the world an easy fast as they gather to observe Yom Kippur. The Day of Atonement is an important reminder of the obligation we all share to reflect on our actions and recommit to our values in the year ahead. L’Shana Tovah.

It’s time we reward work, not just wealth."
"Abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.

Donald Trump has abused the foreign policy of the United States to extract personal, political favors from multiple countries.

He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States. He sees only the power – and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.
"Every day, more evidence is uncovered revealing that Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president. He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal, political interests instead of the national interest."
"Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and has saved lives.

We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. As president, I will protect and build on it."
"President Trump is spending millions of dollars attacking me because he's scared I'll beat him.

But I’m not going anywhere. I won’t let Donald Trump choose the Democratic nominee."
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern history.
"If there are any angels in heaven, they are all male and female nurses."
"We have a president who believes he is above the law and that there is no limit to his power.

He is wrong. We cannot let him get away with this.

Chip in to help us beat him like a drum:"
Donald Trump is the definition of corruption.
"Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and we must fight any and all attempts to overturn it. As president, I will codify Roe into law and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor."
"Health care is personal to me like it is for so many Americans. I promise you, as president, I will protect your family's health care as I would my own."
"It has been 219 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill. Every day since, @senatemajldr McConnell has refused to bring it up for a vote.

Enough. How many more Americans must die for Senate Republicans to stand up to the @NRA and take action?"
Looking forward to joining @SEIU at the #UnionsForAll Summit this afternoon to talk about my plans to protect and strengthen America’s unions and rebuild the middle class. Tune in:
"This is who Donald Trump is.

A president who abuses the power of the Oval Office to win re-election, turns his back on the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, and puts his own self-interest above the public good.

We have to show the world who we are."
"Extreme risk laws save lives. Period.

As president, I will incentivize states to adopt these important laws to help keep guns out of dangerous hands.

Read my full plan to end our gun violence epidemic:"
"It's clear President Trump doesn't care about the farmers and manufacturers being crushed by his reckless trade war—just this week, 160 workers were laid off in the Quad Cities. Enough.

As president, I will end these failed policies and put American workers first."
"I’m not surprised President Trump asked foreign governments for help to beat me and that his special interest friends are spending millions to attack me.

But we can't let the lies, smears, and distortions distract us from what's at stake in this election."
"And to Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum."
"While the House does its job on impeachment, I’m going to stay focused on what matters: improving the lives of Americans and fighting to ensure that the United States is once again the leader of the free world."
"It’s the same cynical playbook he returns to again and again. But this time it won’t work, because the American people know me—and they know him. I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Trump’s lack of integrity any day of the week."

Our children should not have to worry about their safety at school. Enough is enough. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic.
"You should need to pass a background check to buy a gun. Period.

I will enact universal background check legislation and close loopholes that allow guns to fall into the wrong hands.

Read my full plan to end gun violence:"
"Mr. President, you cannot extort foreign governments to help you win re-election. It’s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security. I know you want to rig the primary and pick your opponent, but I’m not going anywhere."
We’re going to do more than just beat President Trump — we’re going to beat him like a drum.
All the progress we've made on domestic violence and sexual assault has been because of people like Bonnie Campbell. Grateful for her kind words in reflecting on the history of the Violence Against Women Act.
"I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against President Trump's long record of lying, cheating, and stealing any day of the week."
"Because of the courage and determination of folks like @GabbyGiffords and groups like @AMarch4OurLives, the fight for gun safety reform has gone from a cause to a movement.

We will end our gun violence epidemic — together. #2020GunSafety"
"President Trump broke his promise to America's farmers. He campaigned on having their backs, but now his administration is abandoning them and claiming family farms might not survive.
 
I will expand opportunities for our farmers — not count them out."

President Trump is morally unfit to lead our country.
"President Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections, and now he's spending $10 million on attack ads against me. It's clear that he is trying to influence the primary and pick his opponent.

Why? Because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum."
"Weapons of war have no place on our streets.

We must take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it again in the White House."

I’ll work for the American people."

"Wonder why President Trump is lying about me? It's because he knows that I will beat him like a drum.

Chip in $5 before tonight’s public fundraising deadline to help us defeat Donald Trump and stop the outrageous lying and cheating he engages in:"
"Being middle class isn’t a number. It’s a value set. It’s about the issues that matter to every American family: a good education, economic opportunity, access to quality, affordable health care.

We've got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, ensure everyone comes along."
Harris County Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal was a hero and a trailblazer who selflessly served his community every day. @DrBiden and I are keeping his family and loved ones in our hearts.
"Grateful for the leadership of @fred_guttenberg for finding purpose in tragedy.

We will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic."
President Trump is trying to hijack this election. We cannot let him get away with it.
"We can combat climate change.
We can end our gun violence epidemic.
We can ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care.

It’s all within our reach if we unite this country. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — together."
"We must end this epidemic of violence against the transgender community — especially trans women of color. It’s up to all of us to stand up and give hate no safe harbor.

Every American deserves to live open, proud, free and without fear."
"Let’s be clear, this attack is designed to weaken our unions and take away workers’ voices on the job. It’s wrong. I stand with Alaska’s public employees."
"The science is clear: we cannot wait to take action on climate change.

On day one, I’ll take unprecedented steps to rally the world and tackle this crisis head on. We can and will solve this — together."
"On Monday, $255 million in funding expires for historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions. Senate Republicans need to pass the #FUTUREAct now. Our students and educators cannot afford to wait."
"President Trump is trying to hijack this election to distract from how he has turned his back on America's families: sabotaging our health care, prioritizing tax cuts for the super-wealthy, and rolling back our progress on climate change.

We won't let him get away with it."

"It is long past time to address the devastating effects of climate change. As president, I will take action against those who knowingly harm our environment."
It’s clear — we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time to pick our heads up and show the world who we are. We are the United States of America — there is nothing beyond our capacity.

It's shameful, and as president, I will reverse his actions."

We are a country that welcomes those in search of a better life—the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free.

Trump doesn't get that."

We can't let President Trump continue to work with states to undermine Medicaid and prevent low-income Americans from accessing health care."
"Every day it becomes clearer, the core values of our nation — our very democracy — are at risk with President Trump in the White House.

We must hold Trump accountable. We cannot let him get away with shredding our Constitution."
I want America to be the envy of the world again.

President Trump’s travel ban—the Muslim ban—remains one of his most egregious attacks on our core values. Spewing the politics of fear & slandering an entire religious community as complicit in terrorism is wrong & goes against everything we stand for. We must overturn the ban.

"President Trump cut outreach programs that help people get health insurance coverage. At every turn, he has sabotaged the ACA and made it harder for Americans to access health care. It's wrong.

I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone receives the care they need."
Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.
President Trump's actions are an abuse of power. They undermine our national security. They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.
The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is — and it’s up to all of us to make our voices heard in every election. Head to   to register to vote and then send it to five friends to get them registered. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay
"Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans and protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. We can't let President Trump and congressional Republicans tear it down.

Add your name if you agree:"

26 tiroteos masivos.

We cannot go on like this. It’s past time we take on the @NRA, pass common-sense gun safety legislation, and end our gun violence epidemic."

So release the transcript of the call then.
"President Trump and congressional Republicans will stop at nothing to repeal Obamacare. We’ve seen how close they’ve come—just one vote away. We can’t give them another chance.

I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care."
"Republicans should never have allowed the 1994 ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines to expire.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA once again to ban these weapons of war and get them off our streets."
"Tonight, you made history, @theebillyporter. And as you did it, you reminded us that there is so much more that unites us than divides us. You blazed a trail that will mean so much to so many young people who can now imagine themselves standing on that stage because of you."
"It’s time we start rewarding work, not just wealth. America's workers deserve better. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @UAW."
"I’m running for president to restore the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, everyone is going to come along."
We must take action to end the gun violence epidemic. Enough is enough.
"El derecho al voto es el derecho más sagrado como estadounidense, y depende de nosotros hacer que se escuche nuestra voz en cada elección. Dirígete a   para registrarte para votar y envíalo a cinco amigos para que también se registren."
"President Trump cut outreach programs that help people get health insurance coverage. At every turn, he has sabotaged the ACA and made it harder for Americans to access health care. It's wrong.

I'll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone receives the care they need."
Pressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win an election — is not the conduct of an American President.
President Trump's actions are an abuse of power. They undermine our national security. They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.
The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is — and it’s up to all of us to make our voices heard in every election. Head to   to register to vote and then send it to five friends to get them registered. #NationalVoterRegistrationDay
"Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans and protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. We can't let President Trump and congressional Republicans tear it down.

Add your name if you agree:"
The pay gap that Native women face — due to both their gender and the color of their skin — is unacceptable. We must right these wrongs and close the gender pay gap once and for all. #NativeWomensEqualPay
"Un verano.
26 tiroteos masivos.
Incontables vidas truncadas.

No podemos seguir así. Ya es hora de que nos enfrentemos al @NRA, aprobemos la legislación sobre seguridad de armas y terminemos con nuestra epidemia de violencia."
"I’ve seen firsthand how hard America’s teachers and support staff work with little support and few resources. They deserve better. I’m proud to support Chicago’s educators as they fight for fair wages, full staffing, and smaller class sizes."
"Amy, you have nothing to be ashamed of and every reason to be proud. Living open and free is a daily act of bravery — bravery that resides in your heart and in the hearts of LGBTQ people around the world. I’m proud to have you on our team. #BiVisibilityDay"
"I always enjoy attending the @PolkDems #SteakFry, but the energy that @TeamJoe brought this year made it my favorite one yet. Thank you for a great weekend, Iowa!"
"One summer.
26 mass shootings.
Countless lives cut short.

We cannot go on like this. It’s past time we take on the @NRA, pass common-sense gun safety legislation, and end our gun violence epidemic."

We must make him a one-term president."
"Today, I proudly stood alongside @UAW members on strike in Kansas City as they fight for a fair contract. Everything that defines a middle class life is because of unions fighting for worker protections. I stand with you, and America stands with you."
We're going to beat Donald Trump. Like a drum. Join us:
"I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has access to affordable, quality health care. With my plan, if you like your private insurance, you can keep it."
"I’m even more optimistic about the future of our country than I was as a 29-year-old in the Senate. We are the United States of America — together, there is nothing we can’t do."
"America was built by hard-working, ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It’s time we start rewarding work, not just wealth."
"Desperate Donald Trump knows that I can beat him, so now he’s enlisting the help of a foreign government — once again. It’s an abuse of power and violates every basic norm of the presidency.

We cannot give him four more years in the White House."

"Hace dos años, el huracán María tocó tierra en Puerto Rico, devastando la isla y robando la vida de miles. En ese momento en que nuestros compatriotas necesitaron más ayuda, el presidente Trump les falló."

At a time when our fellow Americans needed help the most, President Trump failed them."

"We started @ItsOnUs with the goal of ending the epidemic of sexual violence on our college campuses. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made, but we have further to go. As we celebrate #5YearsOfItsOnUs, we must recommit to rooting out the toxic culture once and for all."
"Wealthy special interests and corporations have dominated our politics for far too long.

It’s time we overturn Citizens United and create a public financing system for our elections."
"Siempre estuve orgulloso de servir junto al presidente Obama, pero nunca más que cuando aprobamos la Ley del Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Costo. Como presidente, protegeré y ampliaré Obamacare para garantizar que cada estadounidense reciba la atención médica que merece."
"I was proud to serve alongside President Obama every day, but never more so than when we passed the Affordable Care Act.

As president, I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American receives the health care they deserve:"
"South Carolina is one of only five states without a hate crime law. But this week, @SteveBenjaminSC and the Columbia City Council stood up and declared that hatred and bigotry have no place in their city."
"Jill and I are heartbroken at the passing of Dr. Emily Clyburn. She was a remarkable woman — an activist and community leader, a true partner throughout Jim's career in public office. Jim and the entire Clyburn family are in our hearts during this time of grief."

I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I was first elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old kid. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — if we do it together.
"We need a president who believes in science over fiction. As president, I will fight for rigorous fuel economy standards that protect our health, our environment, and our economy."
"Donald Trump continues his relentless effort to roll back the hard-fought progress we made in the Obama-Biden Administration. Higher auto emission standards make the air we all breathe cleaner, keep us healthier—and keep our auto industry competitive in the global marketplace."
"When domestic abusers have easy access to guns, the result can be fatal. Gov. Sununu should work with the NH legislature to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. 

I wrote & passed the Violence Against Women Act. I’ve taken on the NRA twice — and as president, I’ll do it again."
Another school year is starting. Another month of Senate Republicans’ inaction on gun violence. This powerful ad from my friends @sandyhook captures the physical and emotional consequences of that inaction.

Cokie Roberts was a pioneer. Relentless in her pursuit of the truth and steadfast in her commitment to breaking down barriers for women in journalism—our country is better because of it. @DrBiden and I send our prayers to her loved ones at this time.
"Thank you, South Carolina, for a great evening at the Galivants Ferry Stump. As I discussed last night, we’ve got to rebuild America’s middle class. That starts with repealing President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and rewarding work — not just wealth."
It’s always good to be back at the Galivants Ferry Stump!
"259 days into 2019.

"Helplessly watching your child deal with a life or death condition is one of the worst things a parent can go through. Jill and I are so glad to hear Sadie is doing well, @Bakari_Sellers, and our prayers are with your family as she recovers."
"President Trump’s decision to take billions from the military to build his wall is an unabashed abuse of power. It endangers the American people and forfeits investments in our future, security, and children — all to score political points."
"The Trump Administration is denying Temporary Protected Status to Bahamians escaping the devastation of Hurricane Dorian. It’s heartless and goes against everything we stand for as a nation.

The cruelty of this administration truly knows no bounds."
Barack Obama was a great president. We don’t say that enough.
"Beth James is strong, courageous, and resilient. Her story is the story of millions of women all across this country. It’s why I worked so hard to pass the Violence Against Women Act — and it’s why I’m committed to changing the toxic culture that still pervades our society today."
"All workers deserve the right to bargain for good wages, benefits and working conditions—including gig workers. That is why I'm pleased the CA Legislature passed AB5. As president, I will enact a federal law to ensure gig workers get the full protections they deserve."
"Climate change doesn’t only threaten our environment — it threatens our economy, health, and national security. We must take urgent action to address this crisis before it’s too late."
"Each 9/11, we remember that resilience and courage live in the hearts of all Americans—especially our brave first responders. 18 years later, we reaffirm that Americans will never bend to terrorism, and we will never forget those we lost."

Joe Biden grounded his plan in the science — in what the world’s leading climatologists and the UN tells us we need to achieve. It provides a comprehensive path forward on how to address the most pressing issue of our time.
"Under Joe Biden’s plan for a clean energy revolution and environmental justice, we will: 

✅ Achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050
✅ Rejoin the #ParisAgreement on day one and rally the world to go further
✅ Stand up to polluters

Say thank you—because these are the people who make America run. Not the Wall Street bankers. Not the CEOs or hedge fund managers. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things.

"This Labor Day, when you cross paths with someone working a job that makes your day-to-day life better—and I promise you, it will happen many times today—tell them ""thank you.""

President Trump has found his newest target — sick children. It's sinful.
"Grateful to everyone who attended our town hall at Clinton College. As I discussed this morning, we need to stand up to President Trump’s constant attacks on immigrants and end his inhumane policies. We’re stronger because of our diversity — not in spite of it."

"There is no national security justification for further traumatizing sick kids at their most vulnerable. Like all bullies, Trump is purposefully targeting the little guys—but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer and cystic fibrosis were off-limits."
We are running out of words to condemn the inhumanity of this administration. An administration that pulls children from the arms of their parents and stalks families in their neighborhoods will now deport children who are in life-saving treatment for dire conditions like cancer.

"A year ago, we lost a true patriot, a hero, and to me—a friend. John McCain's character, courage, and honor made him a giant among all of us. His deep, unshakeable belief in the soul of America and our values inspired us all and provided hope to the world. I miss him every day."
"Highly recommend the grilled cheese and milkshakes at Lindy’s Diner. Thanks for a great send-off, New Hampshire!"
"The climate emergency we’re facing not only impacts our environment — it also threatens our health, national security, and economic well-being. We need to take urgent, drastic action now to address it. That’s exactly what I will do as president."
"The people of Keene, New Hampshire, know that if we come together and remember who we are as Americans, there’s not a single thing we can’t do. Thank you to everyone who joined us this afternoon!"
"I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @CWAUnion workers who walked off the job last night. @ATT must respect workers' rights, negotiate in good faith, and work to secure a fair contract."
Had the opportunity to say hello to a few of the folks who couldn’t make it inside our Health Care Town Hall yesterday at Dartmouth College. I’ll make sure we get a bigger room next time!
This election is not a joke.
"After three days, we have even more evidence of how President Trump's disastrous foreign policy has left the U.S. isolated. Rather than looking to America for vision, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year's G-7."
"This ad wasn’t easy for me to record.

Health care is personal to me. Deeply personal."
"The fact of the matter is, the greed of drug companies fueled an opioid epidemic that has ravaged communities in every corner of the country. They should be held accountable for their actions, and this is an important step."
Happy #InternationalDogDay from Major and camera-shy Champ!
The fires ravaging the Amazon are devastating. The Amazon serves as the lungs of our planet and is home to an invaluable number of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth. We must take global action to stop the destruction and support reforestation before it’s too late.
"I’m grateful that Gene shared his story. The battle against cancer is personal for me, like it is for so many Americans. But I’m confident — with the power of America’s best minds — we will end cancer as we know it."
"America was built on a simple proposition: all men — and women — are created equal. We haven't lived up to that promise for most, but haven't stopped trying. As we celebrate the 19th Amendment and #WomensEqualityDay, we must continue our fight to truly achieve equality for all."
"It’s simple—everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. And as I said to Kevin and Michael—LGBTQ rights are civil rights."
No one should have to choose between putting food on their table or filling their prescription. That’s why the Biden administration will stand up to prescription drug corporations and take concrete action to lower costs for Americans. Read more:
"Across the country, folks like Ryan are doing the crucial work of organizing their communities and talking with neighbors about what’s at stake in this election. I’m so proud to have him on our team.

"La emergencia climática que enfrentamos no solo afecta nuestro medio ambiente, sino que también amenaza nuestra salud, seguridad nacional y bienestar económico. Necesitamos tomar medidas urgentes y drásticas para abordarlo ya, lo que haré como presidente."

This election is not a joke.
We have to remember who we are — this is the United States of America. There is not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together.
"Es hora de recordar quiénes somos. Somos estadounidenses: nos tratamos con dignidad, no dejamos a nadie atrás y no le damos cabida al odio."
"It’s time to remember who we are. We are Americans: We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor."
"New Hampshire really is God’s country. Thank you for a great evening, Croydon!"
"I had a great time talking with folks this week in Urbandale, Iowa. We’re in a battle for the soul of this nation, and coming together with our friends and neighbors is how we’re going to win this election."
"The U.S. stood with the Baltic States during the Soviet occupation—their flags always flew in D.C., affirming America's defense of democratic values. Today, we must stand with the people of Hong Kong & ensure the U.S. remains a beacon of hope to people around the world."
"30 years ago, 2 million people joined hands to form the Baltic Way—a chain of human determination that reached across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in defiance of Soviet oppression. It was—and remains—a powerful demonstration of the irrepressible desire for freedom."
"Today, demonstrators in Hong Kong, inspired by the iconic Baltic Way protest, formed a human chain to demand China live up to its promises to the people of Hong Kong. They once more showed the world the common yearning for liberty that unites us all."
"It was great to be back with folks at Dartmouth College today for our Health Care Town Hall.

Health care is one of the biggest issues in this election. A Biden administration will ensure health care is a right not a privilege—and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve."
A man whose erratic tweets send markets spiraling downward should not be sitting in the Oval Office.
".@SethMoulton brought a vital voice to this primary, advocating for the urgent need to undo President Trump’s damage abroad and restore American leadership on the world stage. His passion for and knowledge of American foreign policy are impressive and needed in Congress."
"In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. The @NABTU leaders I spoke with in Concord take up that fight for all of us every day. 

Thank you @IBEW Local 490 for hosting us!"
"President Trump continues to chip away at the progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration. This time, he’s going after the rules we put in place to decrease vehicle emissions. It's backwards.
 
We need a president who believes in climate change."
"Everything workers have that define what it means to live a good life—the 40-hour workweek, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace safety.
 
It’s all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that."
"We need to take action now to address our climate crisis.

That starts with beating Donald Trump."
"President Trump just doesn't get it — he claimed his tax cuts jolted the economy and spurred hiring. He was wrong.

I’ll reverse his giveaway to the super-wealthy and invest in rebuilding America's middle class instead."
"New Hampshire, I’m heading your way to talk about our bold vision for the future of the country and how we’ll get it done — together. Head to   to find an event in your community."
"On Black Women's Equal Pay Day, we must recognize the cumulative discrimination black women face due to both their gender and color of their skin and renew our efforts to close the gender pay gap. When I say we have to rebuild the middle class—that means everyone comes along."
Building a more inclusive middle class is at the heart of this presidential campaign. That's why I support @Culinary226 and the Station Casino workers who voted to unionize. The will of the workers must be respected and management has to come to the negotiating table immediately.
"Eleven years ago, I received a phone call from President Obama asking me to be his vice president. The decision to join him and serve this country was the greatest honor of my life."

Firefighters face danger every day to protect our communities—we must be there for them in their time of need. Our thoughts are with the families of Justin and Brian as the search continues—and we thank those working tirelessly to bring their brothers home.
A Democratic president will need a Democratic Senate in 2021 to reverse the damage that @realDonaldTrump has done to this country. Coloradans are fortunate to have @Hickenlooper in the race and continuing the fight.
".@JayInslee brought an important voice to this race, arguing powerfully that climate change damages our health, national security & economy. The people of Washington are fortunate to have a Governor who fights to make their lives better now & to protect our planet for the future."
"On day one, I will eliminate President Trump’s decision to limit asylum and undo his executive orders that eliminated Obama-Biden enforcement priorities on national security and public safety."
"It is cruel and abhorrent to strip migrant children of the few protections they have. It's not enough this administration puts children in cages without soap and beds, now it wants to keep them there indefinitely. This isn't who we are."
The super-wealthy don’t need another tax cut. Period.
"Today, I was glad to be back amongst friends at the @IowaAFLCIO convention. These folks are the ones who built the middle class, and we’re going to rebuild it together."
"Hope you had a great first day of school, @DrBiden! Your students are incredibly lucky to have you as their professor. I can’t wait to hear how the day went."
"“Because he had learned about bullies first hand, he developed a deep sense of compassion and empathy for their targets, along with a lifelong commitment to stopping them.”

My sister Valerie is my best friend. Read her full post here:"
"Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden Administration — just like he inherited everything in his life.

Now, he’s in the process of squandering it."
"Once again, President Trump has folded to the @NRA and broken his promise to pursue the most modest of gun safety policies.

I give you my word as a Biden: I won’t rest until we pass universal background checks and ban assault weapons. We will end our gun violence epidemic."
"Mr. President, these comments are insulting and inexcusable—just like your previous dual loyalty insinuations. Stop dividing Americans and disparaging your fellow citizens. It may not be beneath you, but it is beneath the office you hold."
It’s good to be back in Iowa! We kicked off our trip by discussing our bold vision for the future with some great folks in Warren County and Urbandale. Thank you to everyone who came out.
"The Trump Administration has argued that migrant children held in detention centers don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds. Now they’re refusing to provide flu vaccines after three children have already passed away in part from the flu.

It is inhumane."
"Our teachers and firefighters should not pay a higher tax rate than Wall Street CEOs. That’s why I’ll repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and close capital gains loopholes.

It’s time we reward work, not just wealth."
"We all know in our bones that this election is different. The stakes are higher. The threat is more serious. We have to beat Donald Trump.

That’s the message we lay out in our first TV ad hitting the airwaves today. Watch it below:"
We will make Donald Trump a one-term president.
"The Trump Administration’s Title X rule is a direct attack on Planned Parenthood and the crucial services the organization provides. Access to health care could be taken away from millions of women. It’s wrong, and as president I will reverse it."
"Extremism is on the rise in America, fueled by a president who has fanned the flames of division and emboldened white nationalists and Neo-Nazis with messages of support.

This is a battle for the soul of our nation, and it's on all of us to act."
"It’s past time for a $15 minimum wage and a real pathway to the middle class, because no one in America should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty level. No one."

"Back in 2007, I had the opportunity to meet with Katie and talk with her about how to overcome a learning disability. Her story has stuck with me ever since. I'm glad we were able to catch up in Iowa, and I'm so proud to hear she has graduated from school."

"The Trump Administration is trying to eliminate protections for LGBTQ workers that President Obama and I put in place. It’s wrong.

As president, I’ll ensure every American is treated with dignity and respect—regardless of who they are or who they love."
We cannot afford four more years of a president who ignores the disastrous effects of climate change. My plan for a Clean Energy Revolution & Environmental Justice will address the climate emergency & protect our communities for generations to come.
"My plan to protect and build on Obamacare will not only provide coverage for uninsured Americans, but it will also make health care more affordable for those who already have coverage."
"A new school year is here—we must recognize those working to prepare our students to succeed in tomorrow’s economy: educators.

As President, I will ensure our educators are supported with the pay and dignity they deserve. Read my plan here:"
"Every single community should have access to clean, safe drinking water."
Let’s be clear: racism and hate have no safe harbor in America. We are stronger because of our diversity—not in spite of it.
"President Trump has lied to Iowa farmers at every turn. He promised to ‘unleash ethanol’ but instead all he’s done is secretly unleash Big Oil from its renewable fuel obligations.

I'll support our farmers—not sell them out to the highest bidder."
Every day President Trump proves how morally unfit he is to sit in the Oval Office. A president should bring out our best as Americans — not echo schoolyard bullies with taunts based on physical appearance.

Coal miners have powered our country from the Industrial Revolution to the 21st century. I'm proud to stand with the protesting miners. Blackjewel has an obligation to give its workers the pay and benefits they’ve earned.
"Since 1978, CEO compensation has risen 940%, while the average American has seen a raise of just 12%. It’s wrong. We need a $15 minimum wage, stronger labor laws, and a tax code that works for the middle class.

It’s time we reward work, not just wealth."
"Gov. @Hickenlooper ran a strong campaign, talking about the urgent need to rebuild our middle class and standing up to President Trump's trade wars. Coloradans are lucky to have John in their corner, and I look forward to seeing what he does next."

We deserve better from our elected officials."

"America is an idea. An idea that for centuries has offered hope to the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. 

We won’t let Donald Trump and his administration change that."
"Whether you are online, at a gun show, or in a store — you should have to pass a background check to buy a gun. Period."
"President Trump has emboldened white nationalists with messages of support, called Mexicans ""rapists,"" and told members of Congress to ""go back"" to where they came from.

The words of a president matter. And Trump has used his to unleash the deepest, darkest forces in our nation."
"This is America, and we are strong and great because of our diversity — not in spite of it. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.

Prioritizing wealthy immigrants while punishing working-class ones betrays the American idea that everyone gets a fair shot — regardless of background."
"I know what it takes to beat the @NRA because I’ve done it twice before. In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I took on the gun lobby to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and helped pass the Brady background check bill.

As president, I’ll beat them once again."
"The brave protestors in Hong Kong are demanding the rights and freedoms promised to them. The U.S. should be leading the free world to rally support behind them and, with one voice, defend our shared democratic ideals and the desire for liberty that beats in every heart."
"It’s unacceptable that children learn to fear mass shooters alongside their ABCs.

It's unacceptable that people feel unsafe on their weekly grocery run.

It's unacceptable that living in fear of gun violence has become our new normal."
Don’t tell Champ and Major.
The vast majority of Americans want common-sense gun safety reform. We need leaders with the backbone to stand up to the @NRA and get it done.
"For decades, the Endangered Species Act has protected our most vulnerable wildlife from extinction. Now, President Trump wants to throw it all away.
 
At a time when climate change is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them."
"If we cannot rise to meet this moment, it won’t just be a political failure. It will be a moral one. It will mean that we accept the next inevitable tragedy.

We cannot allow that to happen. We must end our gun violence epidemic."
"There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you worked hard, you were able to share in the prosperity you helped create.

That bargain is broken for American workers, and it's time we restore it."
"Two years after Charlottesville, we have a problem with this rising tide of white supremacy in America. And we have a president who encourages and emboldens it. But if we stand together in opposing it, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation."
"As president, I will do everything in my power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic by passing common-sense gun reform. Lives depend on it."
".@DrBiden and I wish everyone celebrating #EidAlAdha hope, faith, and joy. Eid Mubarak!"
"In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I led the successful effort to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It worked. It saved lives.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and ban military-style weapons onceagain."
"We need universal background checks for gun sales. Period. 

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again as president. It’s time for a leader who stands up to the powerful gun lobby."
"Before I was Vice President, before I was a Senator — I started my career as an elected official on the New Castle County Council. Local races matter. I'm proud to sign the @runforsomething pledge to support candidates up and down the ballot to invest in our party’s future."
"Rep. Steve King should resign. His comments on rape and incest have no place in Congress and fuel a corrosive culture in this country around sexual assault.

We deserve better from our elected officials."
".@DrBiden and I send our prayers to the police officers injured today in Philadelphia, and to their families who wake up every day knowing that their loved ones are walking into harm's way when they put on the badge. We're grateful for the selfless work they do to keep us safe."
"America is an idea. An idea that for centuries has offered hope to the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. 

We won’t let Donald Trump and his administration change that."
"Whether you are online, at a gun show, or in a store — you should have to pass a background check to buy a gun. Period."
"President Trump has emboldened white nationalists with messages of support, called Mexicans ""rapists,"" and told members of Congress to ""go back"" to where they came from.

The words of a president matter. And Trump has used his to unleash the deepest, darkest forces in our nation."
"This is America, and we are strong and great because of our diversity — not in spite of it. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.

Prioritizing wealthy immigrants while punishing working-class ones betrays the American idea that everyone gets a fair shot — regardless of background."
"I know what it takes to beat the @NRA because I’ve done it twice before. In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I took on the gun lobby to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and helped pass the Brady background check bill.

As president, I’ll beat them once again."
"The brave protestors in Hong Kong are demanding the rights and freedoms promised to them. The U.S. should be leading the free world to rally support behind them and, with one voice, defend our shared democratic ideals and the desire for liberty that beats in every heart."
"It’s unacceptable that children learn to fear mass shooters alongside their ABCs.

It's unacceptable that people feel unsafe on their weekly grocery run.

It's unacceptable that living in fear of gun violence has become our new normal."
Don’t tell Champ and Major.
The vast majority of Americans want common-sense gun safety reform. We need leaders with the backbone to stand up to the @NRA and get it done.
"For decades, the Endangered Species Act has protected our most vulnerable wildlife from extinction. Now, President Trump wants to throw it all away.
 
At a time when climate change is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them."
"If we cannot rise to meet this moment, it won’t just be a political failure. It will be a moral one. It will mean that we accept the next inevitable tragedy.

We cannot allow that to happen. We must end our gun violence epidemic."
"There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you worked hard, you were able to share in the prosperity you helped create.

That bargain is broken for American workers, and it's time we restore it."
"Two years after Charlottesville, we have a problem with this rising tide of white supremacy in America. And we have a president who encourages and emboldens it. But if we stand together in opposing it, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation."
"As president, I will do everything in my power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic by passing common-sense gun reform. Lives depend on it."
".@DrBiden and I wish everyone celebrating #EidAlAdha hope, faith, and joy. Eid Mubarak!"
"In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I led the successful effort to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It worked. It saved lives.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and ban military-style weapons onceagain."
"We need universal background checks for gun sales. Period. 

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again as president. It’s time for a leader who stands up to the powerful gun lobby."
The words of a president matter. Hateful rhetoric and white nationalism have no place in our nation.
"Thank you to @Everytown and @MomsDemand for hosting today’s #GunSenseForum.

As I said this afternoon, spread the faith. Talk with friends and neighbors about what's happening in America. Demand change. Because together, we can and will end our gun violence epidemic."
"Assault weapons don’t belong in our communities. Period. As president, I’ll ban these military-style weapons and institute a buyback program that gets as many as possible off our streets."
"July was the hottest month on Earth ever recorded — making it clearer than ever that climate change is already here and requires our urgent, drastic action.

On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on."
"Now is not the time to cower in the face of the @NRA, now is the time to stand up with courage and conviction and pass gun safety legislation. Lives depend on it."
There’s no better place than the Iowa State Fair to meet some new folks and stop for ice cream. Thank you to everyone who said hello!

"Five years ago, Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson. His death stirred the conscience of our nation and awakened a generation of activists. We must ensure justice rings out for all in America — regardless of skin color."
"At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up.

We don’t have that today. We have a president who has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation. And that makes winning the battle for the soul of this nation that much harder."
Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets.

"This is who Donald Trump is: a president determined to terrorize immigrant communities and rip apart families — at the border and across our country.

The question is, who are we? I believe we are a nation that will end these cruel policies and make Trump a one-term president."
"Along with Senator Feinstein, I got assault weapons and high-capacity magazines banned in this country for ten years. As president, I’ll make sure they’re banned once again."
"On a day when President Trump is supposed to be embracing a grieving community and celebrating our American diversity in El Paso, his administration is instead stoking fear by conducting massive immigration raids in Mississippi.

He is morally unfit to lead this country."
The @NRA doesn’t own this country. We the people own this country.
"In both clear language and in code, President Trump has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."

We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s why I’m running for president.
We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes.
"We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes.

If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation."
So it’s up to us. We’re living through a rare moment in this nation’s history. Where our president isn’t up to the moment. Where our president lacks the moral authority to lead. Where our president has more in common with George Wallace than George Washington.
"Trump offers no moral leadership, no interest in unifying the nation, and no evidence the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least.

Instead, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division."
"At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up. They led, opposed hate, and chose to fight for the best of the American character.

We don’t have that today. Our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation."
"The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. But it’s never a rout. It’s always a fight. And the battle is never finished."
"I wish I could say this hate began with Trump and will end with him. It didn’t & it won’t.

The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull between the American ideal that we are all created equal & the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart."
"In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."
"How far is it from the white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville – Trump’s “very fine people” – chanting “You will not replace us” to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying Jews “were committing genocide to his people.”

Not far at all."
"How far is it from Trump’s saying this “is an invasion” to the shooter in El Paso declaring “this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”?

Not far at all."
I said at the time that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I said it again when I announced. It’s why I’m running for president.
"When he said after Charlottesville that there were “very fine people on both sides” he gave license and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.

Those words stunned the nation and shocked the world."
"The words of a president matter. They can move markets. They can send our brave men and women to war. They can bring peace.

And they can unleash the deepest, darkest forces in this nation — like Donald Trump has chosen to do."

A president is supposed to unite our nation and lift us up. Not prey on our divisions and tear us down.

Mr. President, it’s long past time you stood up to it."
"Thoughts and prayers won’t solve our broken gun laws. We need politicians with the courage to stand up to the powerful gun lobby and tell them that they don’t own this country.

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again in the White House."
"Honesty, decency, hope, leaving nobody behind, giving hate no safe harbor. That’s who we are. But I don't see much of that coming from this administration."

"Mr. President, immigration isn’t the problem. White nationalism is the problem. America’s inaction on gun safety legislation is the problem.

It’s time to put the politics aside and pass universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. Lives depend on it."
"Enough is enough. As a nation, we need to take common-sense steps to end this epidemic of gun violence.

@senatemajldr Mitch McConnell should reconvene the Senate and pass the House’s universal background check bill. We cannot wait to take action."

How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It’s past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic."

That starts with beating Donald Trump."

There is nothing moderate about what President Obama did with Obamacare. Nothing. Seven presidents tried to expand access to health care — the Obama-Biden Administration finally got it done.

Mr. President — this is America. We are strong and great because of our diversity. #DemDebate
"Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are.

We choose science over fiction, hope over fear, and unity over division. #DemDebate"
"I just got off the stage where I shared my bold vision for our future built on uniting our country. Because I know if we work together, there’s nothing we can’t do.

Let's keep our momentum going. If you liked what you heard tonight, text JOE to 30330 and let's get to work."
That’s all we have for tonight’s #DemDebate—thanks for tuning in! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to keep up-to-date with everything happening on our campaign.
"Debate Night #2 is in the books.

#DemDebate"
"We can protect our interests in Afghanistan, including the possibility of a terrorist threat re-emerging, without a large troop presence. That is what Joe Biden will do as president."
"Joe Biden has long believed that the US should narrow rather than broaden its military efforts in Afghanistan, and has for years advocated for ending the war responsibly. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars a year to sustain a stalemate.
#DemDebate"
"Joe Biden believes that women have a constitutional right to choose. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and Biden will work to codify it. He’ll continue to fight for a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions with her doctor.
#DemDebate"
"Finally, Joe Biden has been integral to some of the biggest child care tax credit wins in our history, including in the Recovery Act and the fiscal cliff deal.

And as president, he'll expand the child care tax credit to up to $8,000 per family.
#DemDebate"
"Here's the truth about Joe Biden's vote:

He wasn't opposed to the child care tax credit itself. He was opposed to this specific tax credit being made available to affluent people."
"This attack from Senator Gillibrand has been two weeks in the making, and it STILL isn’t accurate. Let's set the record straight:"
"Vice President Biden has fought for women's rights his whole career:

✓Wrote the Violence Against Women Act
✓Co-sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment 9 times
✓Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act: 1st Obama-Biden bill signed into law 
✓Co-sponsored the Pregnancy Discrimination Act"
"When it comes to trade, either we're going to write the rules of the road for the world or China is—and not in a way that advances our values. 

Meanwhile, this administration has launched trade wars against the very allies we need with us to change China’s behavior.
#DemDebate"
"Biden will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. He’ll work to ensure that communities across the country from Flint, MI to Harlan, KY to the NH Seacoast have access to clean, safe drinking water."
"Joe Biden has received more than 100 endorsements from community leaders around the country, including Detroit's own @MayorMikeDuggan.
#DemDebate"
"In 2009, the Obama-Biden administration made a big bet on rescuing the US auto industry. It paid off:

-More than 646,000 auto jobs
-Auto production doubled in the US
-Auto sales hit an all-time high

Detroit was on the front lines of that recovery.
#DemDebate"
"Climate change requires drastic action.

Joe Biden has a comprehensive plan to tackle our climate emergency and environmental injustices head on:  
#DemDebate"
"Climate change poses an existential threat to our health, our communities, our national security, and our economic well-being. 

As president, Biden will rally the world to address the climate emergency and lead through the power of example. #DemDebate"
"Two Delaware civil rights champions on the Joe Biden they know, and why they're proud to stand by him and call him a friend:"
"If we want to talk about the Crime Bill, let's hear from the President who chose @JoeBiden as his running mate—twice."
"The 1994 Crime Bill included: 

-The ground-breaking Violence Against Women Act
-Bans on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines
-Funding for drug courts and prevention

#DemDebate"
"Joe Biden will strengthen America’s commitment to justice and reform by taking action to reduce our prison population, address racial disparities, and make our communities safer.
#DemDebate"
"Joe Biden has the boldest, most comprehensive criminal justice reform proposal in this election.

"Under Medicare for All, Americans will see a new type of deductible in their paycheck. Medicare for All costs $30 trillion. Not sure what math they do in New York or California but that would be a lot of money."
Las políticas de inmigración de Trump son un asalto a la dignidad humana. No somos un país que niegue a los niños jabón y cepillo de dientes. Esto no es lo que somos. #DemDebate
Trump's immigration policies are an assault on human dignity. We aren't a country that denies children soap and a toothbrush. This is not who we are. #DemDebate
"Donald Trump is the problem with our immigration policy. He's using family separation as a weapon against desperate people seeking safety and a better life.

We need to defeat Donald Trump. #DemDebate"
Let’s get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan—and it will be paid for by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate
"Because of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million Americans gained health insurance. Millions more gained critical protections. But the work isn’t over. As president, Biden won’t rest until everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they deserve. #DemDebate"
"As Vice President, Biden was a champion for efforts to implement the federal mental health parity law, improve access to mental health care, and eliminate the stigma. 

As president, he'll enforce our mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services."
Senator Harris’ Medicare for All plan still gets rid of employer-sponsored coverage and still costs 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan. Just changing the start date by 6 years doesn’t change the fact it is bad policy. #DemDebate
I’m running for president to restore the soul of this country...No one man has the capacity to rip that apart. It’s too strong. We're too good.

Joe Biden’s plan to protect and build on Obamacare is the best way to achieve universal coverage and lower costs:"
Americans prefer protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option over Medicare for All:
"Healthcare is the most important issue to Americans. Senator Harris won't be able to beat Trump with double-talk on healthcare.
We have a plan that builds on the ACA by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate."

"We deserve leaders that unite us around our shared goals, rather than prey on our divisions. That’s why I’m running for president. To unite our country and put us on a different path — not back to a past that never was — but to a future that fulfills our true potential."
"Detroit — and our country as a whole — is like its people: resilient and tough. Defined by a work ethic that is unmatched by any place in the world. And when given half a fighting chance, there’s nothing the American people can’t do."
"As we gather in Detroit, it’s important that we recognize the significance of the Motor City. Because few cities embody the American spirit better than Detroit.

When it was knocked down flat on its back, it didn’t give up. It came roaring back."
"Tonight, I’ll take the stage in Detroit for the second #DemDebate. I’m excited to have the opportunity to discuss the issues on voters’ minds, why I’m running for president, and my bold vision for the future of our country."

"Here's the deal, President Trump inherited the economy from the Obama-Biden Administration. And just like everything else he's been given in his life, he's in the process of squandering it."
I’ve got some exciting news: I am now on Snapchat! Subscribe to get a behind-the-scenes look at tonight’s #DemDebate and what’s happening on the campaign trail:
"A car accident took the lives of my first wife and baby daughter. My family was fortunate to have health insurance, but that's not the case for many.
 
This is why I fight. I believe deeply that health care is a right for all—not a privilege for the few."
"On what would have been his 46th birthday, my thoughts are with the family of my friend Reverend Clementa Pinckney. As we celebrate his life, let's continue on his legacy by living with compassion, kindness, and a relentless dedication to improving the lives of others."
"President Trump & Betsy DeVos continue to roll back our progress on LGBTQ rights. No child should feel unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

A Biden administration will ensure all of our young people are affirmed & accepted exactly as they are."
My plan builds on that legacy with a new public health insurance option like Medicare. Read the full plan here:
"54 years ago, President Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. This landmark legislation changed the lives of millions by providing the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care."

"We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic — that starts with taking on the powerful gun lobby and passing common-sense gun safety laws.

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice. And I’ll do it again in the White House."
The Affordable Care Act changed the life of @DrBiden’s sister — like it did millions of Americans — by giving her access to the health care she needed. We can’t afford to start over.

Our thoughts are with everyone in Gilroy this evening. Enough isenough."

We’ve got to rebuild America’s middle class and ensure everyone gets a fair shot."
"America’s strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. But President Trump continues to spew hateful rhetoric, sow division, and stoke racial tensions for his own political gain.

Let's be clear: Racism and xenophobia have no place in America."
"Thank you to everyone who joined us in Londonderry, New Hampshire, where we discussed our plans to build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability."
Las redadas de inmigración (ICE) del presidente Trump son inhumanas. Sus tácticas no resuelven nada. No deberíamos estar aterrorizando comunidades y dividiendo familias. Debemos proporcionar un camino hacia la ciudadanía y encontrar una solución duradera.
It’s young people like the @NHYoungDems that give me so much hope and excitement for the future of our country.
President Trump’s ICE raids are inhumane. His scare tactics solve nothing. We shouldn't be terrorizing communities and splitting up families. We should provide a pathway to citizenship and find a lasting solution.
I’m heartbroken to hear of the passing of Héctor Figueroa. Héctor was a stalwart champion in the fight to ensure every worker receives the respect and dignity they’ve earned. My thoughts are with his family and his loved ones.
"Had the opportunity to spend some time with the great residents of Atkinson, New Hampshire, today. Thank you all for the warm welcome into your community!"
"As individuals, and as a nation, we have to prove to the world that the United States is prepared to lead—not just with the example of our power, but the power of our example.

I will take decisive steps to renew our core American values and return transparency to our government."
It was a pleasure spending time with the inspiring young leaders of the @NHYoungDems — especially @RepDenny — in Portsmouth. Thank you to everyone who came out tonight!
"Had to pull the team over for a quick ice cream stop! This time we’re at Annabelle’s Ice Cream in Portsmouth, NH."
"Thank you to everyone who joined us in Dover, New Hampshire! We had a great time discussing how we will rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class."
The threat Donald Trump poses to our national security — and to who we are as a country — is so extreme we cannot afford to ignore it.
"We have to champion liberty and democracy, reclaim our credibility, and look with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future."
"We have to champion liberty and democracy. We have to reclaim our credibility. We have to look with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future.

Head to   to read our full plan."
"We must once more harness that power and rally the Free World to meet the challenges facing our world today—and it falls to the United States of America to do it.

No other nation has the capacity. No other nation is built on that idea—that promise. And it’s in our self-interest."
"No army on earth can match how the electric idea of liberty passes freely from person to person, jumps borders, transcends languages and cultures—how it can supercharge communities of ordinary citizens into activists and organizers and change agents."
A Biden administration will place the United States back at the head of the table to mobilize global action on global threats—especially those unique to our century.
"We know that economic security is national security. But there are a lot of communities across this country that are hurting—because we’ve neglected the basics.

We will equip our people to succeed in the global economy with a foreign policy for the middle class."
"I will invite my fellow democratic leaders to put strengthening democracy back on the global agenda.

We will organize and host, during the first year of my administration, a global Summit for Democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the Free World."

First, we must repair and reinvigorate our own democracy."
"The threat Donald Trump poses to our national security, and to who we are as a country, is so extreme we cannot afford to ignore it.

His erratic policies and failures to uphold basic democratic principles have muddied our reputation and our place in the world."
"In 2019, foreign policy is domestic policy, and domestic policy is foreign policy. They are a deeply connected set of choices we make about how to advance the American way of life and our vision for the future."
"Today in New York City, I laid out my foreign policy vision for America. A vision built on restoring dignified leadership at home and respected leadership on the world stage."

"Embracing dictators. Threatening war. Embarrassing the United States.

That’s the #TrumpDoctrine.

Reclaiming American leadership starts now."
"Today, we celebrate Journeyman Lineman Recognition Day and the work @IBEW does to keep lineworkers safe. These brave men and women do the hard work of powering America’s electric grid, economy, and future. Our country can't function without the important work they do."
"Our campaign starts at the local level — neighbors talking with neighbors and organizing their communities in every corner of the country. If you’re ready to get to work, sign up to host an organizing meeting for our nationwide Day of Action on July 20th:"
"President Trump can avoid talking about climate change all he wants, but it doesn’t change the fact that it is real, is here, and requires our urgent action.

We can't afford four more years of a climate change denier in the White House."
"New Hampshire, I’m heading your way this weekend to talk about our plans to rebuild the backbone of the country — the middle class. Head to   to find an event in your community. Hope to see you there!"

"I know the history of this country. I’m amazed how far we’ve come, but I know how much further we have to go.

We can get there — together."
Here’s what I commit to you: I will name a Secretary of Education who is an educator.
"The abuse of a child is one of the most heinous, despicable abuses of power imaginable. It is inexcusably poor judgment for a US Attorney to seek leniency for someone guilty of it. Secretary Acosta should provide his resignation immediately."
"We can’t tear down the ACA. We should protect and build on it. In America, health care should be a right—not a privilege.

As president, I’ll do everything in my power to stand up to the attacks on the ACA and expand coverage to ensure everyone has access to the care they need."
"The Affordable Care Act was and is a big deal. It covered 20 million more people, protects more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and expanded Medicaid — giving millions of Americans the peace of mind that comes with health insurance."
"Today, the Affordable Care Act is back in the courts — putting the health care of millions of Americans at risk. It’s clear some will stop at nothing to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we’ve made."
"Thank you to everyone at our town hall discussion in Charleston, South Carolina, for your thoughtful questions on ending gun violence, combating the opioid epidemic, and ensuring every American has access to quality, affordable health care."

His leadership on the House Intelligence Committee and his influential voice pushing the Trump Administration to secure our elections have helped make clear the stakes for our country in next year's election.
".@EricSwalwell ran a passionate campaign, and I commend him for bringing more attention to the urgent need for gun safety reform in America."
"It was the honor of my lifetime to serve with a man who I believe was a great president, a historic figure, and most important to me, a close friend.

He selected me. I’ll take his judgment about my record, my character, and my ability to handle the job over anyone else’s."
"If we don't defeat Donald Trump, the character of this nation will be fundamentally and forever altered."
I had the opportunity to meet Cameron Boyce at this year’s Courage Awards and through his work with @ItsOnUs. He was filled with so much light and served as a tremendous role model for young people. He's gone far too soon. @DrBiden and I are sending our prayers to his family.

Had the opportunity to meet some incredible Iowans at yesterday’s parade in Independence. Thank you to everyone who came out to celebrate the #FourthOfJuly and the values that this country stands for.
"Looking forward to joining @NEAToday to discuss my plan for #StrongPublicSchools. I know from watching @DrBiden all these years that, for educators, their profession isn’t just what they do, it’s who they are — and it’s time we support them with the pay and dignity they deserve."

"Will he offer a robust defense of the democratic values that have always been our strength in times of crisis? We all know the answer to that.

Donald Trump is incapable of celebrating what makes America great because he doesn’t get it."
What will Donald Trump say this evening when he speaks to the nation at an event designed more to stroke his ego than celebrate American ideals? Will he speak to the example America must set to inspire the world?
"As I celebrate today with friends & family, I am reflecting on the promise those rebels envisioned 243 years ago. America hasn’t lived up to that promise for most people—but we’ve never stopped trying. We must continue in our pursuit until we achieve equality & liberty for all."
"We have to be against his policies that are further entrenching economic inequality in this nation. That are rigging the system against the middle class.

That too is an attack on our democracy, on our liberty."
"It’s not enough to be against the way Donald Trump conducts himself — we have to be against the way he assaults the dignity of women, people of color, and immigrants."
"We have to take on the inequalities in our system that are causing too many today—in America and around the world—to question their faith in the ability of democracy to deliver for them.

It’s not enough to be for political equality. We have to be for economic fairness as well."
"My liberty, depends on yours. Our liberty as a nation rests on our ability to ensure equal access and equal opportunity — not just for our own children, but all our children."
"But we must also remember, as JFK put it, that ours is “not the individual liberty of one but the indivisible liberty of all.” Donald Trump doesn’t get that."
"America is the heart of the Free World, and we must defend it. That is how the #FourthOfJuly is best honored — by remembering that our Declaration is first and foremost a call to arms, in defense of liberty."
"And ever since then, presidents and patriots have gathered together on the Fourth to reflect on the greater meaning of our American experiment."
"243 years ago, a group of rebels in Philadelphia pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to a revolutionary idea, to the self-evident truth that all men — and women — are created equal."
"It’s fitting that we’re celebrating Independence Day in Independence, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who said hello at this morning’s #FourthOfJuly parade — it was great to see so many supporters!"
"America is an idea — stronger than any army, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. Instills in us the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.

That's worth celebrating. Happy #FourthofJuly"
Thank you to everyone who came out to our event in Waterloo! RSVP to join us tomorrow in Independence and Marshalltown:
DREAMers—young people who came to the U.S. as children—are Americans. They don’t deserve to sit in limbo as the Supreme Court decides whether President Trump can end the Obama-Biden DACA policy. Congress should act now to give them a path to citizenship.
"South Carolina, I’m heading your way this weekend to talk with you about how we’ll build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along. Head to   to RSVP for an event in your community."
"Rooms of people packed body to body. Kids being held without access to showers or a change of clothes. It’s simply abhorrent.

We all have a moral obligation to keep speaking out until this administration ends these inhumane policies once and for all."
"El Departamento de Comercio anunció que el formulario Censo 2020 no tendrá la pregunta de ciudadanía de Trump. Esto no es solo una victoria para los inmigrantes y latinos, sino para todos los estadounidenses. Todos merecemos ser contados sin temor!"

"But as we mark the 55th anniversary, we must recognize that the work is not done. Too many Americans still face the sting of systemic racism and discrimination. We must double down on our efforts to root out these evils and ensure America lives up to its promise for all."
"It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow — from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We’re all made better."
"The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination."
It took the courage and determination of generations of African Americans who refused to wither in the face of racism and intolerance. Their resolve fundamentally changed the character of our nation for the better.
"Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all."
"The Department of Commerce just announced the 2020 Census will not have President Trump’s citizenship question. This is not only a victory for immigrants and Latinos, but for all Americans. Everyone deserves to be counted and have their voices heard without fear."
"Luis Alvarez was an American hero—@DrBiden and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to his family.

No one should have to spend their final weeks fighting for the health care and benefits they deserve. We must do better for our 9/11 first responders."
"Make no mistake, this is a modern-day poll tax that overturns the will of Florida voters. It’s unacceptable.
 
We must ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voices heard at the ballot box."
"One in five students experience mental health problems, but too often they don’t get the care they need. In a Biden administration, we will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve."
"Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant giveaway to the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class.
 
That starts by rewarding work, not just wealth."
"Iran has now restarted its nuclear program and has become more, rather than less, aggressive. Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East.

Everything this president does is backwards."
"Iran needs to get back into compliance with its nuclear commitments, but Trump appears to have no plan for ensuring that result either. His policy of maximum pressure has produced worse than minimum results."
"And even as Trump has rushed to legitimize a dictator in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons, he trashed the Iran nuclear deal — a deal that was working to keep Iran far away from a single nuclear bomb."
"Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. If anything, the situation has gotten worse. North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage."
"Diplomacy is important, but diplomacy requires a strategy, a process, and competent leadership to deliver. After three made-for-TV summits, we still don't have a single concrete commitment from North Korea."
"In this case, all Trump achieved was a mere promise to restart working-level negotiations — negotiations that should have never ended."
"Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un — a murderous tyrant — on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing."
"President Trump’s failure to lead on the climate crisis is inexcusable — it endangers the future of our country and planet.

As president, I’ll rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to push our progress further and faster."
"If we want to make Donald Trump a one-term president, it’s going to take everyone stepping up and pitching in what they can. Will you make a donation before our big public fundraising deadline tonight?"
"This week, I’m heading back to Iowa to talk with voters about why I’m running for president and my bold vision for the future. Head to   to RSVP to an event in your community. Hope to see you there!"
"But as we mark the 55th anniversary, we must recognize that the work is not done. Too many Americans still face the sting of systemic racism and discrimination. We must double down on our efforts to root out these evils and ensure America lives up to its promise for all."
"It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow — from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We’re all made better."
"The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination."
It took the courage and determination of generations of African Americans who refused to wither in the face of racism and intolerance. Their resolve fundamentally changed the character of our nation for the better.
"Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all."
"The Department of Commerce just announced the 2020 Census will not have President Trump’s citizenship question. This is not only a victory for immigrants and Latinos, but for all Americans. Everyone deserves to be counted and have their voices heard without fear."
"Luis Alvarez was an American hero—@DrBiden and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to his family.

No one should have to spend their final weeks fighting for the health care and benefits they deserve. We must do better for our 9/11 first responders."
"Make no mistake, this is a modern-day poll tax that overturns the will of Florida voters. It’s unacceptable.
 
We must ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voices heard at the ballot box."
"One in five students experience mental health problems, but too often they don’t get the care they need. In a Biden administration, we will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve."
"Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant giveaway to the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class.

It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better."
"Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely."
"Planned Parenthood helps women and individuals get the health care they need — especially preventive services like cancer screenings, mammograms, checkups, and contraception.

Thank you to @PPact for having me at today’s #WeDecide Forum to discuss these important issues."
"I support @PPact because women and transgender individuals' health care is essential. Historically, women — and particularly women of color — have been put in a position where they cannot access health care, in a more extreme way more than any other part of the population."

We must stand up, speak out, and put an end to this hate."
This month marks 50 years since a movement was born on Christopher Street — a movement that has delivered so much acceptance & hope & pride for the LGBTQ community. I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever.
"What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies."
Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.
"It’s sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.

By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need."
"But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability."
He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.
President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
"As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we’ve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we’re working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations."
"Thank you for a great weekend, South Carolina!"
"Trump sólo está interesado en políticas que atacan la dignidad de la comunidad Latina y asustan a los votantes para que se presenten en las urnas el día de las elecciones, sin interés por abordar los desafíos reales que enfrenta nuestro hemisferio."
"It’s clear Trump is only interested in using his policies to assault the dignity of the Hispanic community and scare voters to turn out on Election Day, while not addressing the real challenges facing our hemisphere.

"The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are “safe and sanitary”.

It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better."
"Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely."
"Planned Parenthood helps women and individuals get the health care they need — especially preventive services like cancer screenings, mammograms, checkups, and contraception.

Thank you to @PPact for having me at today’s #WeDecide Forum to discuss these important issues."
"I support @PPact because women and transgender individuals' health care is essential. Historically, women — and particularly women of color — have been put in a position where they cannot access health care, in a more extreme way more than any other part of the population."
It’s always great to be back at the #ClyburnFishFry. Thank you to @ClyburnSC06 and everyone who came out for a great night!

"America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, & fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black."
"Trump’s policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it."
President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values.
"This is truly the most important election of our lifetime. If we want to defeat Donald Trump, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action.

Join our team today and let’s get to work:"
"Trump’s response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it’s not just that. It’s happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections. 

We’re better than this."
"Trump continues to undermine our standing in the world.

Our core values of inclusivity, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion are under attack here at home and abroad."
"Just look at his tax plan.

As president, Biden will reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy. It’s time we reward work, not just wealth."
"Let’s be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he’s in the process of squandering it."
"Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:"
"For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten — this fight is not over.

We have to come together to stand up to abuses of power, ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, and fight for full equality."
Stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate #PrideMonth & #WorldPride where the movement began 50 years ago.

"Under President Trump’s policies, a four-month-old was separated from his family at the border. It’s unconscionable and fundamentally at odds with everything our nation stands for.

America is better than this."

"It will also include premium-free access to this public option for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but have been denied access to it by governors and state legislatures who have refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion."
"Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it."
"I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote."
"I discussed how in a Biden Administration, we’ll support teachers and ensure every kid has access to a quality education. Because in America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability."

That starts with access to a real living wage — a $15 minimum wage."
"I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum."
"Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent."
"Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into ""Mother Emanuel"" and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation."
"7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them & continues to threaten their status.

DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them."
"Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile! 

As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it’s past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam"
"As my father believed, there’s no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there who work every day to help raise their children—and all our children—to be honorable, generous, kind young men and women."
"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that.

We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth."
"In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we’ll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

Read the plan here:"
"The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties & autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom."
This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people — not Vladimir Putin.
"Donald Trump doesn’t think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He’s dead wrong.

That’s why I’m signing the Pledge for Election Integrity. I refuse to help those who seek to undermine our democracy."
Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits — and the right to collectively bargain. I’m proud to stand with Detroit security officers today as they fight for a $15 minimum wage and union rights. #OneDetroit
"Had great pancakes and great conversation at Tasty Cafe in Eldridge before heading to Clinton Community College for our final event this trip. Thank you for a great few days, Iowa!"
"I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth."
President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country — the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us!
"Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, & fairness.

The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it."
"Our 9/11 first responders represent the best of our country — selflessly rushing into danger to save others. We owe them so much, and the least we can do is provide the health care and benefits they deserve. 

Thank you, Jon Stewart, for continuing to have their backs."
"Prayers are not enough to end these senseless mass shootings. This violence is not normal. As a country, we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop the gun violence epidemic."

President Trump thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall.
"Tomorrow, we’re heading to Clinton, Iowa, and hope to see you there! RSVP at   and spread the word to family and friends."
President Trump is bringing his secret one page agreement with Mexico to Iowa. The Iowans being crushed by his tariffs would like to see it.
Good luck to the @USWNT as they kick off their first game of the Women’s World Cup. @DrBiden and I will be rooting for you! We have no doubt you’ll make our country proud. #OneNationOneTeam
Thank you for following along this afternoon! Follow @TeamJoe to keep up with everything happening on the campaign. #TeamJoe
We can’t afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe

"President Trump’s decision to abandon the #ParisAgreement wasn't just reckless—it abdicated our leadership on the world stage and threatened the future of our planet.
 
On day one, I’ll rejoin the Agreement and rally the world to push our progress further."
"Jill & I were thrilled to be there today to watch our amazing granddaughter Maisy graduate. Maisy, you make us so proud & we can’t wait to see what you do next with your talent, smarts, dedication and kindness. The future is yours, and Nana & Pop will always be right behind you."
"As president, I’ll lead America to become the world’s clean energy superpower."

"Iowa, we’re heading your way next week and hope to see you there! Go to   to RSVP to an event in your community."
"Make no mistake, how we act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. We’ll make the largest investment in American history to tackle the climate emergency head on and protect our planet for future generations."
"This campaign is about listening to communities and working with them to find solutions to the issues on their minds. Yesterday we held a roundtable to do just that.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories with me in Atlanta."
"I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again."
We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
"We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it’s clear we need to: 
- Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check.
- Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."
There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
"Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America."
"Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code."
"Today, we honor all those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died."
Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—one that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved—for all of us.
"With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice."
"75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance."
"We can’t afford four more years of President Trump attacking the progress we’ve made on climate change. On day one as president, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head on."
We had a great few days on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! I look forward to being back soon.
"Across America, mayors are stepping up and leading the way on combating climate change. Thank you to @MartyForBoston for showing me the innovative work Boston is doing to protect the city from rising sea levels and increased flooding."
"Iowa, we’re heading your way next week and hope to see you there! Go to   to RSVP to an event in your community."
"Make no mistake, how we act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. We’ll make the largest investment in American history to tackle the climate emergency head on and protect our planet for future generations."
"This campaign is about listening to communities and working with them to find solutions to the issues on their minds. Yesterday we held a roundtable to do just that.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories with me in Atlanta."
"I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again."
We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
"We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it’s clear we need to: 
- Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check.
- Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."
There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
"Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America."
"Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code."
"Today, we honor all those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died."
Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—one that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved—for all of us.
"With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice."
"75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance."
"We can’t afford four more years of President Trump attacking the progress we’ve made on climate change. On day one as president, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head on."
We had a great few days on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! I look forward to being back soon.
"Spent yesterday afternoon in Plymouth, NH, discussing how we build our Clean Energy Revolution. Under our bold new plan, the United States will be a 100% clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.

"Estamos enfrentando una emergencia climática y debemos tomar medidas drásticas ya. Por eso, hoy, estoy anunciando mi plan para una Revolución de Energía Limpia y Justicia Ambiental."
"China’s continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can’t be ignored. Human rights must be at the core—not periphery—of our engagement in the world."
Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles & tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced & still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.
"Making these revolutionary changes is going to take an incredible commitment at all levels, but I know we can meet this challenge.

Because this is what America does best—solving big problems, with big ideas. If you agree, please sign your name here:"
We need to dramatically accelerate our worldwide effort to meet the intensity of the challenge we face. I hope you'll read my full plan to tackle the climate emergency and environmental injustices:
"I will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on Day One. But that’s not sufficient.

I’ll immediately get to work leading a diplomatic initiative to get every nation to go beyond their initial commitment—to push our progress further, and faster."
We’ll hold polluters accountable for the damage they've caused—particularly in low-income communities and communities of color.
"This initiative will create new, good-paying jobs all across the clean economy in the United States of America. It’s an enormous opportunity."
"We’re going to make record-breaking investments in research and development and zero-carbon technologies so that America is the engine of the world’s clean economy.

The United States will be a 100% clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050."
"Science tells us that how we act, or fail to act, in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. As president, I will use every authority available to me to drive progress.

I will accept no half-measures."
"Today, President Trump denies the evidence in front of his own eyes, hides climate science produced by his own administration, and actively works to roll back what progress we have already made.

It’s reckless, it’s irresponsible, and it’s unacceptable."
"We are in a climate emergency and we must take drastic action now to address it. So today, I’m announcing my plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice."
"We have a major problem with educational inequality and we need to tackle it head on. In a Biden Administration, we’ll triple Title I funding — creating a historic investment in schools serving a high proportion of children from low-income families."
"Happy birthday to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. Jilly, I love you."
"I’m looking forward to traveling to New Hampshire this week to talk to voters about my plans for our country. 

RSVP to join us in Berlin or Concord today:"
"Thank you @HRC for having me tonight in Columbus. At a time when we’re seeing the forces of hate and intolerance push back on the progress we’ve made, your courage and grit gives me hope. I will always stand beside you as we fight for equality."
"Gun violence occurs every day across America. Enough is enough.
Not every life lost makes national headlines, but it's just as painful for those left behind. This is an epidemic plaguing our communities & destroying our children’s futures. We must act now."
"Pride is about standing up to the voices of injustice and discrimination and declaring that everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. It's about love. We join the LGBTQ community in celebration and remember the fight is not over. We march on. Happy #PrideMonth"

11 innocent lives cut down. 11 more futures denied. When will we finally say enough is enough? It’s long past time to hold our leaders accountable. Jill and I are heartbroken that more American families are suffering tonight in Virginia Beach.
America’s teachers have been forced to make ends meet with too little pay and too few resources. That changes with a Biden Administration. We’ll finally support our educators with the pay and dignity they deserve.
"One in five children experience mental health challenges, but too many don’t get help. My plan doubles the number of mental health professionals in schools to ensure every student gets the support they need.

"Every day, we’re witnessing the Trump Administration attack the hard fought progress made by the LGBTQ community. We can't go backwards. It's up to all of us to stand up to these injustices. I'm looking forward to joining @HRC tomorrow to talk about the work that remains."
"Thad Cochran was a friend and a true patriot in every sense of the word. Jill and I are sending our condolences to Thad’s family, he will be sorely missed."
Jill and I were honored to join today’s Memorial Day service in Delaware. We must remember the brave women and men — and their families — who gave everything in service to our nation.
"Thank you @KamalaHarris from me, Jill, & all the Bidens for your kind remembrance of Beau today. 

My dad used to say that you know you are a success as a parent when you turn & look at your child & realize they turned out better than you — I'm so proud of the man Beau became."
"We’ve got to invest in every child — regardless of zip code or race or parents' income. In a Biden Administration, we’ll provide high-quality, universal pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

Read the full plan:"
"South Carolina would be lucky to have @harrisonjaime representing them in the Senate. He has the character, intelligence, and integrity needed to serve his community well. I hope you'll #JoinJaime."
Our motivated students make me believe America’s best days are still ahead. Thank you to Mayor @Mike_Rawlings and @SPARKDallas for a great afternoon.
"We had a great first day in Texas! Thank you to @rweingarten and @AFTunion for the discussion on how we improve our education system. It's time we increase teacher pay and ensure that no child’s future is determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability."

"Our children are our future, it’s time we start investing in them from birth."
It’s our responsibility to provide every middle and high school student a path to a successful career.
"In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability."
We must invest in our public schools so students can grow into healthy adults and educators can focus on teaching.
It’s time we give our educators the pay and dignity they deserve.
"Our plan will increase teacher pay and provide them with the support they deserve. We’ll invest in all children from birth, so that regardless of their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability they are prepared to succeed in tomorrow’s economy."

I can promise you this: I will do whatever it takes to make progress on the issues that matter most.
I know how to make government work — not because I’ve talked or tweeted about it. But because I’ve done it.
"I’m proud to stand with @SEIU and workers across the country today in the #FightFor15. We must restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone’s treated with respect. That starts with raising the minimum wage to $15, strengthening our unions, and creating safe work environments."
"Over the last year, six children have tragically died in US custody at the border. It’s unacceptable. It’s not who we are. And silence is complicity. It’s on all of us to stand up and speak out. America is a nation of immigrants. We must guarantee everyone's treated with dignity."
"On Saturday, we officially kicked off our campaign in Philadelphia — the city that brought our nation together over 200 years ago. I’m running for president to unite our country, because when we come together and act as one America there’s nothing we can’t accomplish."
"In the 25 years since we passed the Violence Against Women Act, we’ve made great strides in protecting women from abuse. But the latest reauthorization is being held up by the @NRA. It’s outrageous. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue—the Senate should pass the #VAWA immediately."
Our politics today has become so mean and petty — it traffics in division and our president is the divider in chief. This is not who we are.
We were born of an idea that every single person — no matter where they come from — can achieve anything if they work at it.
"That’s why I’ve spent my whole career fighting — and I will continue to fight — like hell so that no one ever has to make that walk again.

If you’re with me, I hope you'll join my campaign and chip in what you can:"
"My dad had to make that walk in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It wasn’t until I was older that I realized how hard it must have been for him.

But he was not alone. This story isn’t unique to the Bidens. Too many people around this country have had to make that walk."
"And he doesn’t understand that the longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child’s bedroom to say, honey, I'm sorry. We have to move. You can’t go back to your school. You won’t see your friends because Daddy or Mommy lost their job."
Trump doesn’t understand the struggles working folks go through. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to worry you will lose the roof over your head. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to wonder if you’ll be able to put food on the table.
"Yesterday, Trump tried to attack me at his campaign rally by saying I abandoned Pennsylvania.

I’ve never forgotten where I came from. My family did have to leave Pennsylvania when I was 10 — we moved to Delaware where my Dad found a job that could provide for our family."
States across the nation are passing extreme laws that violate a woman’s constitutional right to choose. These bills are a blatant attempt to overturn Roe v Wade. It's wrong. It's pernicious. We must #StopTheBans and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor.

"I’m so excited to be in Philadelphia — the birthplace of American democracy — to launch our campaign. I’ll be taking the stage soon, head to   to tune in."
"No one should be fired, denied a home or access to services because of who they are or who they love. But that’s not the reality for many LGBTQ Americans.

Today’s historic passage of the #EqualityAct moves us one step closer to righting this wrong — the Senate should act now."
At the core of our campaign is the idea that we always do better when we act as one America. If we choose unity over division there’s nothing we can’t do. Tune in tomorrow at 1 PM ET to join us as we kick off our campaign in Philadelphia:
Thank you to the @NVAssemblyDems & @NVSenateDems for their hard work — and the people of Nevada for making this a reality. The Silver State is in good hands with these women leading the way.
"Our campaign is built on restoring the American idea, that all men and women are created equal. That’s why we’re basing our campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- the birthplace of this great experiment, American democracy."
Los EEUU fueron fundados con una simple frase: We the people. Nosotros el Pueblo. Me postulo para Presidente para unificar nuestro país y asegurar que alcancemos el ideal de nuestros fundadores. Únase este sábado en Filadelfia para lanzar nuestra campaña:
"I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.

If you’re with me, join us as we launch our campaign in Philadelphia this Saturday:"
"It was good to be back in New Hampshire! Thank you to everyone who came out to join us in Hampton, Manchester, and Nashua."
"Thank you to the hundreds of people who joined us yesterday in the cold and rain in Nashua, NH. Our political system is broken, but I’m more optimistic about America’s chances today than I have ever been. If we come together and remember who we are, there’s nothing we can’t do."
"Republicans in AL, FL, GA, and OH are ushering in laws that clearly violate Roe v Wade and they should be declared unconstitutional. Roe v Wade is settled law and should not be overturned. This choice should remain between a woman and her doctor."
Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or who they love. Now is not the time to back down. We must stand up to this Administration's intolerance and ensure America lives up to our founding ideals.
"We simply cannot accept that the number of uninsured Americans is growing. We need to defend the Affordable Care Act and build upon the progress we made to ensure every American has access to high quality, affordable health care."
"This Saturday, we’re officially launching our campaign to unite this country in Philadelphia — the city that first brought our nation together over 200 years ago. We’d love to see you there, head to   to RSVP and learn more."
Every American should be encouraged to exercise their right to vote. I stand with @JeanneShaheen in opposing the voter suppression law that makes it harder for students in New Hampshire to participate in our political process. This law should be overturned.
"Join us in Philadelphia on Saturday, May 18th, as we officially launch our campaign! Head to   to RSVP today."
"Our campaign starts at the local level. Neighbors talking with neighbors, communities coming together—that’s how we’ll change the country. That’s why we’re organizing watch parties all across this nation to launch our campaign. Sign up to host yours today."
"New Hampshire, we’re heading to Manchester tomorrow and we’d love to see you there! Head to   to RSVP."
"My mom was an incredible woman, and I miss her. She would always tell us that “courage is the greatest virtue, because without courage you cannot love with abandon.” She lived her life that way, loving us with abandon. I want to wish every mother out there a Happy Mother’s Day."
#TeamJoe is hosting house parties across the country to help kick off our campaign. RSVP at   to attend a watch party in your community.
"New Hampshire, we’re taking our campaign your way next week! Head to   to find an event near you."
"Can’t make it to Philadelphia for our kickoff rally on Saturday, May 18th? Visit   to attend a watch party in your community. #BidenForPresident"
We need policies that reflect this urgency. I'll have more specifics on how America can lead on climate in the coming weeks.

I’m proud to have been one of the first to introduce climate change legislation. What I fought for in 1986 is more important than ever — climate change is an existential threat. Now. Today.
Our movement’s strength is rooted in communities all across this country. That’s why we’re bringing together #TeamJoe to officially kick off our campaign. Sign up to help by hosting a watch party in your community at  .
"It’s time we restore the great American middle class that built this country. That starts with making a $15 minimum wage the law of the land, ensuring health care is a right not a privilege, and creating a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth."
"Thanks to my friend, Mayor @EricGarcetti for the tacos yesterday in Los Angeles. I’ll be back soon and the ice cream is on me."
I’m proud to stand with Uber and Lyft drivers across the country today. Every worker in this country deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.

We must remember Kendrick's name and sacrifice. We must ensure his legacy lives in our shared commitment to stopping these tragedies. Children shouldn’t fear going to school and parents shouldn't need to rely on the uncommon courage of an 18-year-old hero to keep their kids safe.
Kendrick Castillo will not collect his high school diploma this week because he gave his life trying to protect his classmates from another senseless act of violence in an American school yesterday. My heart goes out to his family and all those affected by yesterday's shooting.
"One year ago, this Administration began ripping apart immigrant families. Putting children in cages. As I told @Astrid_NV and other brave activists today, we can fix our broken immigration system without tossing aside our values."
I’m so inspired by @DrBiden for her dedication to educating future generations. Happy #TeacherAppreciationDay to all the hardworking educators out there!
"Folks, we’re getting ready for our event this afternoon in Nevada and we’d love to see you there! RSVP at:"
"Hey Rocco, happy 9th birthday! Sorry I missed the party. I hope you got some ice cream with that #Biden2020 cookie."
"Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, on the birth of their baby boy! The truth is there’s no better job than being a parent. Jill and I wish you the best of luck on your next chapter."
"On Saturday, Jill and I visited Columbia, South Carolina, to discuss how we’ll build an inclusive middle class where everyone — regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or disability — comes along. Thank you to everyone who joined us, we’ll be back soon!"
"Nevada, we’re taking our campaign to Henderson tomorrow, May 7th! Head to   to RSVP and come join us."
"On this first day of Ramadan, Jill and I wish peace and happiness to Muslims around the world celebrating the holy month. Ramadan Kareem."
"Our country may seem more divided than ever, but I know our best days are still ahead. It’s time we lift our heads up and remember who we are. If you’re ready to get to work, join our campaign today."
"We’re in the battle for the soul of this nation, but I’ve never been more optimistic about our future. If we work together, I know we can get this country back on track. Join our campaign:"
America is an idea that has grown stronger through the unique contributions of Latinos. @latinovictoryus works tirelessly to empower the community — congrats on 5 years.

"Thank you for the warm welcome, Columbia! It’s always great to be back in South Carolina."
"I’ve seen the selfless heroism of firefighters firsthand — they run toward danger and risk their lives every single day for strangers. On International Firefighters' Day, I extend my deepest gratitude to all the men and women who keep our communities safe."
"Tough, resilient, and always full of hope — that’s the America I know and that’s the America we must restore. It’s time to dig deep, take action, and fight for the soul of this nation. Join our campaign and let’s get to work."
"Since we launched our campaign last week, we’ve seen Americans in every corner of the country step up and say they’re in. Will you join us? Head to   and be part of our team."
"Last year, Floridians voted to restore voting rights to those who served their time for felonies. But today, Florida's Senate votes on a bill that would instead create a modern-day poll tax, suppressing the vote of tens of thousands of Americans. This is unacceptable."
"On Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us pause and reflect on the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime.

The events of the last few months remind us that it’s not enough to just say never again—we must speak up and act against hate."
"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and Hedge Fund Managers. It was built by you — the great American middle class. I’m thankful for all the support this week from union membership and their families, including the IAFF."
"Today, the House votes on #HR9, the #ClimateActionNow Act, which restores our commitment to the #ParisAgreement. We need to face facts on climate change. It’s already here. It is a major threat to our future and we simply cannot wait to take action."
Happy 48th Birthday to @Amtrak and the incredible men and women whose tireless work every day keeps the trains running and our country moving.
I’m the proud husband of a teacher and know first-hand the impact of their work. Teachers around the country and in South Carolina deserve to earn a living wage and have smaller class sizes so that America can continue to out-educate and lead the world. #AllOutMay1
"The violence in Venezuela today against peaceful protesters is criminal. Maduro's regime is responsible for incredible suffering. The U.S. must stand with the National Assembly & Guaidó in their efforts to restore democracy through legitimate, internationally monitored elections."
It's no secret that I love ice cream. I enjoyed stopping by The Cone Shoppe in Monticello for some chocolate/vanilla twist soft serve and the chance to talk with some Iowans after our first campaign stop.
"It was great to see many of our first responders and union leaders in Cedar Rapids today. This country was built by hard working Americans like you, and I look forward to being back soon!"
"Today, The House will hold it's first hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment in 36 years. It's way past time to give all people protection under the Constitution--human rights should never be caught up in the whims of whichever political party is in power. We need the #ERANow."
Serving as @BarackObama's Vice President was a privilege and an honor. We share the belief that America is a place where ordinary people do extraordinary things and anything is possible.
"Folks, we’re just getting started! I’ll be heading to Iowa next. Visit   for event details and to RSVP. Hope to see you soon!"
"We must turbocharge our efforts to address climate change that threatens communities across the country. Through clean, renewable energy and cleaner, safer, faster transportation, America will not only help the environment but provide millions of good-paying middle-class jobs."
"Whether you’re covered through your employer, on your own, or not at all - you should have a choice to buy into a public option health plan like Medicare."
"The Affordable Care Act was a huge step forward for this country. Now we have to finish the job and make health care a right, not a privilege, and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve."
"By making post-secondary education and training affordable to and making sure the economy works not only for folks with a four-year degree but also for those who complete on-the-job training and trade programs, too."
"Thank you for the warm welcome, Columbia! It’s always great to be back in South Carolina."

"We need to get rid of the capital gains loophole for multimillionaires. I’m going to change it so millionaires and billionaires don’t pay lower tax rates than teachers and firefighters. We need to reward work in this country, not just wealth."
"Companies continue to squeeze every last penny out of workers, making it harder and harder for Americans to make ends meet. It’s way past time we make a $15 minimum wage the law of the land."
This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers. It was built by you. The great American middle class. That’s the story of America and together we can rebuild the backbone of this nation.
"As I shared in Pittsburgh today, there are three reasons I’m running for President - to restore the soul of our nation, rebuild its backbone - the middle class, and unify all Americans. If you stand with me, join our campaign:"
"I'm sick of this President badmouthing unions. Labor built the middle class in this country. Minimum wage, overtime pay, the 40-hour week: they exist for all of us because unions fought for those rights. We need a President who honors them and their work."
"I couldn't be more proud to have the International Association of Fire Fighters on my team. Unions built the middle class in this country—and as President, I'll fight to strengthen them and grow the backbone of this country."
"I've said it before and I'll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super PAC system. That's exactly what this campaign is doing."
Join me in Pittsburgh tomorrow for a discussion on my plan to build a middle class where everyone comes along. RSVP to let me know you’ll be there:
"Iowa, I'm headed to town this week! Let me know you'll join us by RSVPing at"
"Dick Lugar was among the most decent men I have ever known. Kind, loyal, dedicated beyond measure to the service of the American people. Dick Lugar was my dear friend. 

Jill and I send our condolences to his wife Charlene and the entire Lugar family."
"Wishing everyone in the Orthodox Christian community a peaceful and joyful Easter celebration with friends, family and loved ones. God Bless."
"Jill and I are devastated to hear about today’s shooting at the Chabad Poway synagogue. No one should have to worship in fear.

As a country, we must speak out against bigotry and gun violence. We’re in the battle for the soul of this nation—and it’s on all of us to act."
I have a message for #TeamJoe: Thank you!
I had the privilege to thank one of our grassroots donors. It's because of supporters like Josh we're able to make this campaign a reality and bring this country together.

"The hard working men and women of @UFCW that I met today are going without pay during this strike. If you can, pitch in to make sure that those workers facing the greatest hardship are supported."
My wife Jill always reminds me that any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. Our teachers must have the resources they need & the wages they deserve so that America will continue to lead the world. Great speech today on this from @rweingarten.
"I'm on my way up to a rally at #StopandShop in Boston to stand with some of the 31,000 @UFCW union members who are currently fighting against cuts to wages and health care for themselves and their families. Stand with us:"
"For centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time. It is a symbol of faith & a testament to history. And even as our hearts break to see it burn today during the holiest week of the year for Catholics, I have faith that it will rise again."
This is powerful. I would encourage everyone to read and take to heart Kyle’s message on privilege.
"In the last 5 years, @StopandShop's parent company has bought back billions of dollars in stock. Now they want to cut employee wages & benefits. This is wrong. I stand with the 31,000 @UFCW workers fighting for their healthcare. Join me and support them:"

My wife Jill always reminds me that any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. Our teachers must have the resources they need & the wages they deserve so that America will continue to lead the world. Great speech today on this from @rweingarten.

This is powerful. I would encourage everyone to read and take to heart Kyle’s message on privilege.

Organized labor is why we have a minimum wage in this country. It’s why we have the five-day work week. It’s why we have worker safety standards. It’s why we have a middle class in America. We owe them.
I'll be in Cedar Rapids tomorrow with @Abby4Iowa and @FredHubbell to rally Iowans around reclaiming our democracy. Let us know you'll be there:

We are changing the culture of cancer research — sharing data, breaking down silos, and forming new collaborations.  We can do this."

"Joe Tydings and I were both inspired by JFK & RFK and their call to service. In the Senate, he lived up to their example with an ironclad commitment to fight the abuse of power and work to ensure that every American gets a fair shot. Joe made America better—he will be missed."
"Jason - public service takes many forms, and bravely stepping forward today is exactly that. By sharing your story, you are saving lives. Others will get the help they need because of you. 

Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Diana, and True every step of the way."
Dr. James Allison and Dr. Tasuku Honjo’s immunotherapy discovery uses our own body’s defenses to destroy cancer. Today’s @NobelPrize award is a significant leap toward ending cancer as we know it and paving the path to a cure. Congratulations and thank you.

"Rev. Graham was spiritual advisor to a dozen Presidents - and countless millions of Americans. We remember his example of dignity and humility today, and Jill and I send our thoughts and condolences to the entire Graham family."
I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.
We need to believe women like Colbie. We need to recognize the incredible courage it takes for women like her to come forward. And we need to change the culture so those who live in fear can safely get the support they deserve.
We had the honor of having Jesmyn Ward moderate the 30th event on the #AmericanPromiseTour last night. It was wonderful to share the stage with such an incredible and acclaimed writer to discuss #PromiseMeDad.
I’m in Indianapolis with @southcity22 and we have a message for thousands of fraternity brothers and sorority sisters here at #AFLVCentral and all across the country: #ItsOnUs to end sexual assault on college campuses.

"Proud to call you a friend, @RepJoeKennedy. You captured the idealism and optimism of our party — and this nation. Because you understand that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity. And that in this country, no one gets left behind. Well done."
"At @UDBidenInst, we’re working on the pressing domestic policy challenges of our time. But we can't do it alone. I sat down earlier with our new Policy Board to discuss everything from quality jobs to climate change. Check out the whole team here:"
"Our top priority should be investing in our workers by 1. ensuring they have the skills & opportunities to get a good job, 2. making work pay, and 3. cutting the costs of raising a family. 

Read my thoughts on how we can all help our workers succeed:"
"Let’s give patients full electronic medical records within 24 hours of request, a safe place to store them, and a trusted way to share them. Details matter when using patient data to save and improve lives. 

My @BidenCancer op-ed:"
"Louise Slaughter was an unparalleled champion for women. I worked with her on the Violence Against Women Act, and I will always remember her grit and determination in standing up for women and families every day. She will be greatly missed."
"The people of Pennsylvania’s 18th district showed up yesterday. They demonstrated that they want to be represented by someone who stands up for working people with actions, not just words. Who has heart. They found that in @ConorLambPA. He will represent them well."
"I was in southwestern Pennsylvania with @ConorLambPA last week. Something's changing out there. You can feel the grassroots energy. And that'll beat big money every time. Let's bring this one home. Get out and vote, Pennsylvania."
"Everyone does better when women are able to rise as high as their talents will take them.

On this International Women’s Day, we honor all the brave women who have spoken out this year, and we recognize that our fight is still far from finished.   #IWD2018"
"Sarah, I'm incredibly proud of you. You're a woman of real courage."
"It takes courage to speak out against sexual assault, or to step in to stop it from happening. 

If you know someone who has stepped up to the front lines of this fight, I want to hear about it.

Nominate them today, because #ItsOnUs to change the culture:"
"We need to give young immigrants who came to our country as children permanent assurance that they are safe here, and we need to give them this peace of mind now. They shouldn’t have to spend another day living with fear and uncertainty."
"When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, it included a provision that empowered women to take abusers to civil court. The Supreme Court wrongly struck it down. Now it is time for Congress to step up and fix this."
"Rev. Graham was spiritual advisor to a dozen Presidents - and countless millions of Americans. We remember his example of dignity and humility today, and Jill and I send our thoughts and condolences to the entire Graham family."
I am at a loss for what more to say. I grieve with the families in Parkland today. I grieve with the families across the country who have suffered loss due to gun violence. Congress has a moral obligation to take action and spare more families from this violence.
We need to believe women like Colbie. We need to recognize the incredible courage it takes for women like her to come forward. And we need to change the culture so those who live in fear can safely get the support they deserve.
We had the honor of having Jesmyn Ward moderate the 30th event on the #AmericanPromiseTour last night. It was wonderful to share the stage with such an incredible and acclaimed writer to discuss #PromiseMeDad.
I’m in Indianapolis with @southcity22 and we have a message for thousands of fraternity brothers and sorority sisters here at #AFLVCentral and all across the country: #ItsOnUs to end sexual assault on college campuses.
William Gay is the real deal - on and off the field. He’s using his voice to get other men involved to end sexual assault and domestic violence. He understands what this fight is all about. I’m glad to have you on the @BidenFoundation team @Southcity22.

This country has made great progress in changing the culture around advancing LGBTQ equality and ending violence against women. But there's plenty of work left to do. I'm pleased to have some of the best and brightest minds on these issues working with us.
"Dr. King said that change “comes through continuous struggle.” As we celebrate his legacy today, we’re once again living through a battle for the soul of this nation. We'll win this battle by following his example: standing up, getting involved, and demanding our voices be heard."
"It’s not how a president should speak. It’s not how a president should behave. Most of all, it’s not what a president should believe. We’re better than this."
"Boston has had many great mayors in its remarkable history, and @marty_walsh can proudly take his place among any of them. Thank you, Mayor, for giving me the honor of presiding over your swearing-in today."
"Jill and I, and the whole Biden family, want to wish you a happy, healthy, and safe holiday season."
It’s been five years since 20 first-graders and 6 educators were murdered by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Their families continue to inspire me with their courage in turning tragedy into purpose.
"Ann Arbor - I’m terribly sorry I won’t get to see you this evening, but we want to make sure everyone can safely make it to #AmericanPromiseTour. Be safe in the snow. I’m looking forward to seeing you on February 5th."

"Tomorrow, the people of Alabama will decide whether the United States Senate will gain the courage, character, and integrity of Doug Jones. Find your friends who can vote there, and make sure they're planning on doing it."
"The people of California are on my mind as they suffer through these devastating wildfires. Amidst the loss, I’m inspired by the bravery & commitment of our firefighters. Day after day going back into the flames, risking their lives to save others. Incredible bravery."
"It’s a little too cold for ice cream in Madison, but I hope you liked the cupcakes all the same. Thanks for spending your birthday with me, @ElaineWelteroth - hope this next year is a great one. #AmericanPromiseTour"

I'm going to keep speaking out on the importance of standing up to the Kremlin through my work @PennBiden. My colleague @mikercarpenter and I have written in @ForeignAffairs about the steps we need to take to defend our democracy.
"I've been on the road talking about #PromiseMeDad, the book I wrote about my son Beau, but I've been most amazed listening to your stories. Incredible people overcoming loss, finding hope and purpose in their lives. Thank you for sharing. You inspire me."
No one who has ever met Sandy Winnefeld has doubted his strength or resolve. And no one who reads this article will ever forget it. Sandy & Mary - thank you for summoning the courage to turn your heartbreak into action to end this epidemic.

"You’re going to make us all proud, Danica."
Juanita Perez Williams ran an incredible campaign in Syracuse. So proud of the work she did. And still hoping for a win for Manka Dhingra that will change the shape of Washington’s state Senate!
And mayors like Rick Kriseman and Joyce Craig who are incredible leaders in their communities.
"State legislators like Sara Cambensy in Michigan and Danica Roem, Jennifer Carroll Foy, David Reid, John Bell, and Elizabeth Guzman in Virginia. People who stood up for working people of every stripe."
"Candidates like Ralph Northam and Justin Fairfax, who will ensure that Virginia’s economic recovery continues to reach every town and city in the commonwealth."
"A resounding defeat tonight for President Trump. Voters around the country rejected the ugly politics we have seen this past year. Instead, they chose candidates who unite and inspire us."
"Folks, there's an election happening tomorrow. We've got to keep our eye on the ball. Let's get this done."
These tragedies aren’t inevitable. Don’t let hopelessness win today. We must persist in our efforts to prevent gun violence.
Americans again murdered in a place of worship. Jill and I send our prayers to Sutherland Springs.

John McCain is the real deal. A model public servant. And my dear friend. I was honored to present him with the 2017 #LibertyMedal tonight.
Unilaterally putting the Iran deal at risk does not isolate Iran. It isolates us:

"Spoke to my friend Jim Murren, so proud of the men and women at MGM Resorts. #VegasStrong"
"Jalal Talabani was a champion of the US-Iraq partnership and a friend, whose unifying leadership will be missed."
Barack & Michelle: all of the Bidens send our love today on your 25th anniversary. May you have many more years of joy still to come.
How long do we let gun violence tear families apart? Enough. Congress & the WH should act now to save lives. There's no excuse for inaction.
Appalled by the senseless loss of life in Las Vegas. Jill and I hold all those affected and grieving in our hearts.
Now is not the time to go backward—it's on all of us to stop sexual violence.

America is strongest when we lead with our values—at home and abroad.

Jill and I are praying for the safety of everyone in the path of Hurricane Irma this weekend. Stay strong - the country stands with you.
Any change that weakens Title IX protections will be devastating:

"Incredible progress in cancer research and treatment in just the last year offers new promise and new hope. You can win this fight, John."
John and I have been friends for 40 years. He's gotten through so much difficulty with so much grace. He is strong - and he will beat this.
"I was a senator for 36 years. I can assure you that your call matters. Your viewpoint might not always win, but your senators hear you."

"If you believe health care is a right for all, make sure your senators know that this bill is a big step backward."
All Americans deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing that you can get affordable care. But that’s now under threat.

Jill and I are excited and ready to take the next step toward ending cancer. Are you with us?
"Let's see a bill that actually tries to improve folks' health care, and then we can have a reasonable debate about how to best do that."
"Especially now, when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction, the bill's drastic cuts to Medicaid are cruel."
"Slashing Medicaid hurts kids, the elderly, people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction. All for tax breaks for the wealthy."
The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all—it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy & corporations.
