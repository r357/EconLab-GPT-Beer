My dad got me a drone for Christmas 🔥🔥🔥
All positive vibes
Love everyone
Oxygen cost twenty dollars
😝
🤪

Wait for it...
My dad said he sees a green aura around me so I looked this up and this described me perfectly
Bff
Legendary Christmas
Pulling up in the may bike 😂
Cube and Short 🐐🐐

Yeezy colors
Meanwhile
2019 year of the established miracle
Bob Dylan
"If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I would’ve let it slide
If I’d lived my life by what others were thinkin’, the heart inside me would’ve died
I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the risin’ star, Its up to me"
I will put this in question form     Who has heard of the twelve lost tribes of Judah?  Have you heard that two of the tribes were actually black? 🤔
WE FREE
We free
I love that we are destigmitizing mental health     Gucciman and Quavo have a song Bipolar this is so good for culture

I’m loving the new music I’ve been working on. 6 months off meds I can feel me again.   Remember when dark fantasy came out I used to tweet a storm also.
Keep squares out yo circle
There was a handler with me at TMZ a so called voice of reason that thank the lord no longer is in my circle
I have no more handlers     Only fear god
I give up drinking every week
You don’t make runaway on medication      Even alcohol is and addictive substance called spirits that actually block our earthly connection to our spirit when we drown ourselves in it
I cannot be on meds and make watch the throne level or dark fantasy level music
God has given me this voice for a reason
Perhaps we stop looking at my tweets as rants and start looking at them as therapy testimonials and some even ministry
Man makes plans and god laughs
I need to speak about how Chance demanding that we record in Chicago reconnected me with my roots and also my faith in Jesus Christ
You have to see and feel how happy I am and how strong my family is. We are even stronger because of this through the love and grace of god
People said my career was over after TMZ       I need to show the world that we so called crazy people will not be just written off
I’ve been trying to do a serious interview speaking on mental health but it seems as though all members of press are afraid to speak to someone who has been diagnosed but is still everyone’s favorite super hero
People try to ‘handle you when they think you have a mental problem
We as a society are taking control of our consciousness and raising it together
The paradigm is shifting
We love
Drake and Trav both love Ye more than anyone and I love those guys back. We love everyone
We’re all growing together

It’s like when you see a tv show from the 60s and it’s super racist and sexist
It reminds me of when I said stop hip hop homophobia      It used to be ok for rappers to bash gay people just listen to certain rap records from the 90s and early 2000s
I don’t blame people for not knowing how to handle this that said we as a society will learn together
I am able to experience first hand how people who have mental health issues get written off by society.    Don’t listen to him cause he’s crazy. He’s washed cause he’s crazy etc...
No one would ever choose to end up in a mental hospital and diagnosed with a mental disorder but god chose me to publicly go through this journey and it is beautiful
Drake verbally attacked Cudi when he was in the hospital and went at me after TMZ because I decided to release albums in June   Is snowballed and he refused to meet with me but texted my mother in law and did sneak disses on peoples records that I consider family
People will no longer take mental health for a joke
I know Ariana said this to be cool and didn’t mean no harm but I don’t like even slightest level of slight commentary from someone I know loves and respects me
Erik Oken and I are @Cartier brothers
Typo Lauren Michaels is the goat   The world needs that Ye SNL 👽👽👽
Meeting with Trav tonight bet it never be a checks over stripes line again on a Trav song on Donda
Still waiting to host SNL🤔Lauren in the goat. Ye gotta host
Let’s please meet today  I’m in NY as well
Heard Hideo Kojima is in NY    We need to meet   Does anyone know where he is or how to contact him

I’ve made mistakes and have karma   No man is perfect     The universe will test us
I’m a man about my family and integrity
Broke down doors for sneakers fashion music everything
No artist should ever diss me for clout   Period

I actually like sickomode but I don’t like that that is was sneak disses

I hit Trav earlier today    Now he just hit me    More threats
Drake called me threatening me
It’s not about rap     It’s about family   We have to be close as a family and never let these people infiltrate just for radio spins

Social media can be good but we have to hold the heads responsible for the psychological damage it sometimes causes.
we should be able to participate in social media without having to show how many followers or likes we have. Just like how we can turn off the comments we should be able to turn off the display of followers. This has an intense negative impact on our self worth.

I understand Pusha’s issues as a man if someone mentions your fiancé men go mask off. I’ve done the same myself at times. I love you and I love Pusha and we all have an admiration for each other’s craft.
I did not have any conversations about your child with Pusha. I don’t play with the idea of people’s children after I spoke to Wiz a few years earlier.
I never listened to either diss track that followed but I did hear quotes from both songs after they were released
since we were building as friends and brothers I should have spoken to Pusha about the Quentin Miller bar. There should have been no songs with my involvement that had any negative energy towards you

When I put the dates up I was a bit ramped up doing 25 tweets a day  TMZ happened shortly after     I have to hop on the plane now  will type more when I land
Let me start by  apologizing for stepping on your release date in the first place   We were building a bond and working on music together  including squashing the issues with Cudi at our office.

instead of saying I’m proud you can say I love this
replace pride with love
Follow your heart and find your tribe. Your tribe are people with similar passions
you can love people that you don’t want to go to lunch with everyday
you can love everyone but everyone isn’t your tribe
love everyone
love is infectious

Steve Jobs you are one of my biggest inspirations and your story spirit and drive helps to push me everyday      congratulations on Apple hitting a trillion dollars also congrats to Eddie Q and Johnny Ives and Tim Cook and the entire Apple team
when speaking about sections of the company I like to use the word arms instead of divisions
inject a bit of love like it’s an IV drip
do things from love    not ego and not pride
instead of saying I’m proud you can say I love this
replace pride with love
Follow your heart and find your tribe. Your tribe are people with similar passions
you can love people that you don’t want to go to lunch with everyday
you can love everyone but everyone isn’t your tribe
love everyone
love is infectious
love is generous
pride is one of the deadliest sins
pride is selfish
"How to NOT kill yourself pt 1

Avoid being around people who make you want to kill yourself"
"To make this clear and not weird 
I’ve had these kinds of thoughts and I’m going to tell you things I’ve done to stay in a content place."
I saw the Alexander McQueen documentary and I connected with his journey. I know how it feels to want to take your life back into your own hands even if it means taking your own life.
trust your feelings don’t calculate your perception
break the status quo
stop trying     start doing
love everyone
I’m not taking no advice for the rest of my life
I hate talking about things I’m supposed to talk about
feeling super creative
"this is amazing  @Project2one5 and @TEYANATAYLOR 
We gotta send them some Yeezys though 🙌🙌🙌"
"The universe is on our side, I’m so excited"
"It’s just another example of elitism and classism.   If you read Prince or Michael’s Wikipedia their title is recording artist     

Moving forward anyone working in music should be referred to as a recording artist"
"Music is an art form.   When reporters call me “the singer,” the rapper"" or even the ""pop star"" there’s an air of condescension and patronization.   Those kinds of  journalist are acting like they’re better than us."
I had a sinus headache on a flight once and I got a fucking cat scan after because it was so bad
Whenever you’re feeling down bored irritated or disgruntled just say thank god I don’t have a sinus headache  they feel like the episode of black mirror when the bee went into the guys ear...
creatives need each other
when in doubt... don’t
wholesale is dangerous for creatives
Yeezy is an organization ran by the creative. The creative make the final decisions here.
Chasing validation is like putting your soul in a plank position

I used to spend every moment I had free at the Moss store
the universe is on our side bro
sometimes I have trouble saying no because I want to help everyone
this is new for me but it’s just how I feel now. I don’t know why. I thought my ego protected me from doubters so that I wouldn’t doubt myself but there has to be a better way to do this
Who or what is Kanye West with no ego? Just Ye
I killed my ego
your pride can be and will be used against you
be great without pride
give without pride
😢🙏🙏🙏🙏

Thank you to everyone who supported our 8th number 1 album  🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥   all love   all great energy    all new soundtracks to the summer    all great vibes     all great frequencies
We’re trying new ideas without the fear of not being perfect  It’s just a gut feeling sometimes just making stuff with your friends
We’re here creating in real time just having fun.     I hear the albums blasting out of the cars when I walk down the street.  Kids come up to me and tell me their favorite songs.   We’re experimenting with new sounds structures and ideas.
Just wanted to say I’m up in the morning working on the Nas album  and I’m so humbled by all the love we’re getting on these albums.   We’re still the kids we used to be.

gratitude and happiness best describe what my wife means to me. I’m deeply grateful and purely happy 😊
Daytona is the first project out of Wyoming.  I’m really proud of what we put together.   We’ve spent a year and a half digging for samples and writing. I really appreciate the overwhelmingly positive response that we’ve been receiving.  🙏🙏🙏
before Edward Bernays Americans purchased things based off needs       There was a a time in the 20s when women didn’t smoke in public so Edward Bernays masterminded a campaign to make it culturally acceptable so that companies could sell more cigarettes..it’s that kind of vibe..
the century of self            It’s 4 hours long but you’ll get the gist in the first 20 minutes      Basically Sigmund Frued’s nephew Edward Bernays capitalized off of his uncle’s philosophies and created modern day consumerism

there was a time when we completely operated without phones.  We're addicted to our phones.
Look at your phone as tool not an obligation.    Would you walk around with a hammer in your pocket?    You would pick up a hammer when you needed it   you would never be addicted or obligated to it.  Use your phone like a hammer only pick it up when you need it.
sometimes we all need hugs
🤣🤣🤣
for anyone whose tried to text or call me in the past 2 weeks   I got rid of that phone so I could focus on these albums
rules are structure for people who can’t carve their own path successfully
This is the greatest newsThis is my favorite showI’ve seen every episode at least 5 times each
free thinking is a super power
I’m hyper focused on the now

we’re starting a Yeezy architecture arm called Yeezy home. We’re looking for architects and industrial designers who want to make the world better
naps are awesome
All music coming out of Yeezy sound has to ride like the new Tesla   Yeezy sound is Tesla radio
take a walk outside.  Fresh air is healing
"In a moment of inspiration, energy and excitement I had posted this sketch and would like to acknowledge the true creator of this amazing work, Tony Spackman."
Today I learned that a newly hired designer on the Yeezy team presented work that was not of their own. This person has immediately been let go from the Yeezy brand.
enjoy the present
if you’re in the way of your own life you’ll end up in the way of other people’s lives too
I can’t wait for electric planes.  Elon please hurry up with the ⚡️ jets😭

Through speech it may be saying simply the word love at the end of a phone call or just saying much love.
"I feel it was heavy handed for me to tell people to tell people ""I love you""  I would ask that we show love how ever we want to show love.  It may be a hug it may be a smile or a head nod."
We are all great artists. I said something ego driven in the Charlamagne interview that I'd like to update. I said I was the greatest artist but we're all great artists.

Try to avoid repetition     do meetings in different places and at different times than the normal     break the normal
I'm at Sci-arc and just learned about desalination   Looking at a project by Ashley Morgan Hastings   But I can't tweet the photos 🙈 there's a lot of great projects here
There's a silent majority of people that have been silenced for too long
we're being starved and anyone who starts asking unpopular questions gets demonized. Only free thinkers can change the world
we’re in this so-called information age but we're starving for wisdom
we're dying to be ourselves
Or we’re dying because we've lost our inner child
or at least we're dying to be kids
We’re all kids
What would you do today if you are not afraid of the consequences of failure?
what makes kids so important to learn from psychologically is that they are not afraid to fail
Art is the escape hatch from oppression
Art is the threat to authority
energy is contagious
We can shape our future. I'm an optimist at my core. I know there will be harmony

Trust your feelings. Stop thinking so much
I've got a new challenge for everyone today. Pick somebody that you had an argument with that you think you hate maybe even someone you haven't spoken to in years and contact that person and tell them I love you.

spread love. Put more love into the universe.
we are more worried about what we can lose than what we feel
it's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma
"Instead of doing what you feel 
you just do what other people think you should do"
Your conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people’s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now
try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other.
the concept of loving people has a stigma
my friend said he texted all his friends this morning and said I love you
John Legend new single on line now 😂
This is year one. We can't ad empathy to MAGA by hating. We can only ad empathy with love and time and truly hearing all sides
I really appreciate this dialogue with John Legend because I'm actually very empathetic. Im still the kid from the telethon. I  feel when people think of MAGA they don't think of empathy.
if you feel something don't let peer pressure manipulate you
I tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me that disagree with me and voice their opinion. I respect everyone's opinion but I stand my ground.

just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person.
Though hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer.  Love is.

I'm sitting with Lucian discussing the future of the music industry. Lets bring in David Joseph and Frank Bridgman and Olivier Nusse.
I'd like Scooter Braun to be a part of this new platform we're creating. Scooter is a genius.  He's more than a manager so is Irving.  We all need to sit together.
I'm so happy to hear that Peter Thiel would like to take a meeting. I feel very optimistic about the future.

decentralize
fear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts
no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love
When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.
"I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say ""I love you"" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more."
with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.
And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.
"I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be. 

Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican"
"If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary   
I love Hillary too."
You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.
Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.

"If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary   
I love Hillary too."
You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.
Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.

I am currently the single highest paid person in footwear. That means I make more money on shoes than Michael Jordan.

We have 160 positions to fill by the end of the year. Yeezy will hit a billion dollars this year. It is the 2nd fastest growing company in history. It is a unicorn on its way to becoming a decacorn.
yes I got rid of my last lawyer why? Because he wouldn't come to work full time. I also asked my last manager to come work full time for Yeezy of course the last lawyer and manager said no. So now I hired a CEO and a CFO and i have two full time lawyers as of now.
"I'm nobody's ""client"""
I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed
spread love
2024
never a master. Always a student.
to be great is to be misunderstood
"dragon 🐉 energy 
Natural born leaders
Very instinctive 
Great foresight"
you can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it.
If your foresight is incredible   Stay stubborn to your vision
I’ve always had a desire to do things people wouldn’t even think to do
everyone should be their own biggest fan
even Prince once had an access pass
life is more exciting than the movies
Donald Glover is a free thinker
I feel like im 18 year old again when I make beats for Nas
new ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses. We are on the frontier of massive change. Starting from breaking out of our mental prisons.
we're evolving at warp speed
This is the funnest car I’ve ever driven

I'm super chaaaaaarged.  Bout to take this whole thing to mars
I heard these are really good for the environment 🙏
I really love my Tesla. I'm in the future. Thank you Elon.
Nas June 15th
I'm hand producing all the albums I tweeted about. Been chopping samples from the sunken place 😂Pusha May 25th My album June 1st me and Cudi June 8th and Teyana June 22nd and oh yeah...
practice pure love
It’s no more baring people because they have different ideas.
self victimization is a disease
there was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality.
People respect people for following the general  trend and consensus
We live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselves
Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there
The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought
we have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought
People demonize people and then they demonize anybody who sees anything positive in someone whose been demonized
The psychological zombie effect
Demonization has metastasized
the blinders are off
question everything
The more people contribute to real time global consciousness the faster we evolve

get past the past
be fearless. Express what you feel not what you've been programmed to think.
live in love not in fear
I don't subscribe the term and concept of God fearing.  That's a dated mentality that was used to control people. We are in the future. If God is love and love it's the opposite of fear then...🤔🤷‍♂️ to fear God makes no sense 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
only free thinkers
I love the way Candace Owens thinks
the world is our office
Yeezy is based in Calabasas but will also be setting up offices in New York London and Wyoming
style is genderless
strive for universal consciousness not segregated consciousness
everything is so planned these days. People appreciate spontaneity and honesty.
iterations of ideas are how culture evolves.
sharing is community holding information is capitalism
images are limitless and words aren't. Words are defined
I don’t believe in horizontal hierarchy. If you build a ladder too high it’s actually most dangerous for the people at the top.
all you have to be is yourself
I need a water proof silk nylon as soon as possible.
people are celebrating real ideas and vibe. Not just hype
we need to Aman Giri the world
the beauty is in the imperfection(s)

it's called Kids See Ghost. That's the name of our group
me and Cudi album June 8th
June 1st
my album is 7 songs
it's not where you take things from.  It's where you take them to
we're all servants
today will be the greatest day so far. Life keeps getting better and better.
if you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them.
truth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I'll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth
don't trade your authenticity for approval
let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.
"I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like ""this person stole this from me"" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂"
Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️
too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update.
There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.
Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see.
me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.
"I will work on this ""book"" when I feel it. When We sit still in the mornings We get hit with so many ideas and so many things We want to express. When I read this tweet to myself I didn't like how much I used the word I so I changed the I's to We's."

oh by the way this is my book that I'm writing in real time. No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write. This is not a financial opportunity this is an innate need to be expressive.
"everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to ""the simulation"".  Parents are our first acting coaches."
"in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner"
just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.
You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness.
I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you.
Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.
You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can.
when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.
trend is always late
be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear.
Fear often causes people to be manipulative
everything you do in life stems from either fear or love
Sometimes you have to get rid of everything
distraction is the enemy of vision
try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas
You have to protect your ability to create at all cost
As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency
often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and  friends
Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness
